                        cause a movement along that curve and inevitable tolerance
                        of neo-nazis logically also implies that to prevent this one
                        must always take action against the "worst" users. Iteratively,
                        following this logic means you will eventually have to ban
                        /all/ your users, in order to ensure you don't run the risk
                        of having neo-nazi users.This is just obvious non-sense.Common-sense
                        is that you set a bar. You take action against gross violations.
                        You maybe warn people in and around the bar. And everything
                        obviously under the bar you just tolerate. That means tolerating
                        different views and disagreement, under that bar.There will
                        inevitably be some users who feel the bar is too high, some
                        too low. That's OK. Get used to it. Develop tolerance. That's

                    invoking the parable of the nazi bar[0] is not at all about calling
                    anyone a neo-nazi.It's simply relating the fact that, since the
                    standards of a community are set by the worst person you don't
                    ban, the logical conclusion of hands-off moderation is your site
                    eventually being overrun with awful people, up to and including,
                    eventually, Nazis. And that preventing this gets harder (and more
                    "controversial") the further along that curve you are.Nazis are
                    not invoked as an absolute statement on the current status quo
                    of this site, then. While awful stuff including fascist rhetoric
                    is somewhat regularly allowed, our editor is at least decent at
                    removing the more virulent commenters. (Although you can still
                    say pretty much whatever you want as long as you're superficially
                    polite about it or jaqing[1]). It is instead a warning as to the
                    inevitable endpoint of the current policy.[0]https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Nazi_bar[1]https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions
