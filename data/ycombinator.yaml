- comment: '&gt; boots in 1&#x2F;3rd the time of OpenRC on the same system<p>Wow,
    that&#x27;s a suspiciously impressive difference. I was under the impression that
    OpenRC and systemd support similar parallel service startup features and usually
    boot systems in approximately the same amount of time, with maybe a slight edge
    to systemd. 3x speed makes me wonder if there&#x27;s something else going on,
    like the current early systemd port having some bugs that cause it to incorrectly
    skip some important work.<p>Either way, super cool. What&#x27;s the likelihood
    that this ends up getting upstreamed?'

- comment: 'It couldn&#x27;t be massively supported until it took over, though? It&#x27;s
    more than a little platform effect going on, it&#x27;s not all by virtue of systemd
    being just all over great. It has some great ideas but it&#x27;s an entire world
    unto itself which feels very NIH-ish.<p>Edit: I think it serves as both a warning
    and an inspiration. Don&#x27;t let a duct tape solution (such as for instance
    boot via rc shell files) live for too long, or it might be replaced by something
    baroque.'

- comment: I&#x27;m with you, if what you&#x27;re saying is that containerized applications
    are a cop-out. In the other hand, they have their uses. For example Valve seems
    to have a hard time packaging Steam (being a weird 32bit web browser with DRM),
    but their flatpak works nicely, and because it&#x27;s closed source it&#x27;s
    your best option.<p>(Also I think it&#x27;s too kind to include Snap with the
    others, I find it uniquely objectionable since it&#x27;s neither convenient nor
    functional.)

- comment: Not sure if I agree. Sed is widely known and much of the value comes from
    that, just being around for a long while, but I wouldn&#x27;t really say that
    the syntax is all that straightforward. As a thought experiment, try explaining
    how to use sed to a fresh graduate who&#x27;s never seen it. Not saying sd is
    better or anything, but rather that just because the syntax is different doesn&#x27;t
    make it bad.

- comment: '&gt; try explaining how to use sed to a fresh graduate who&#x27;s never
    seen it<p>Well, for starters, you just `s&#x2F;&lt;regex&gt;&#x2F;&lt;replacement&gt;&#x2F;`
    and try to use that in your everyday work. Just forget about the syntax. It&#x27;s
    a search-and-replace tool.<p>That&#x27;s the only way I used sed for years. I&#x27;ve
    learned more since then, but it&#x27;s still the command I use the most. And that&#x27;s
    also what `sd` focuses on.<p>Also, if you want to replace newlines, just use `tr`,
    to hook onto the examples of sd. It may seem annoying to use a different tool,
    but there are two major advantages:

    1. you&#x27;re learning about the existence, capabilities and limitations of more
    tools

    2. both `sed` and `tr` are probably available in your next shitty embedded busybox-driven
    device, while `sd` probably is not<p>As you said, the value comes from being around
    for a long time and, probably more importantly, still being present on nearly
    any Unix-like system.'

    utility doesn&#x27;t even honor my language settings and just errors out if I
    enter a non-English letter. It&#x27;s ridiculous

- comment: I&#x27;ve gotten into it recently but actually not because LLMs. Actually
    I find them unhelpful here. The reason I&#x27;ve gotten into it is because I wanted
    to make a bunch of install scripts for programs I want on fresh boxes. Mostly
    it&#x27;s been fun. Seeing what I can do with curl, sed, awk, regex, and bash
    scripting. I&#x27;m often finding that I can do a ton of things in a single line
    where I would have done a lot more if I wrote it in python or something else.
    Idk, there&#x27;s just something very fun about this.<p>Though what&#x27;s been
    a little frustrating is that there&#x27;s anti scraping measures and they break
    things. But they&#x27;re always trivial to get around, so it&#x27;s just annoying.<p>A
    big reason LLMs and up failing is that I need my scripts to work on osx and nix
    machines. So it&#x27;s always suggesting things to me that work on one but not
    the other. It seems to not want to listen to my constraints and grep is problematic
    for them in particular. Luckily man pages are great. I think they&#x27;re often
    over looked.

    dump about 150GB of Postgres logs a day (I know, it&#x27;s over the top but I
    only keep a few days worth and there have been several occasions where I was saved
    by being able to pick through them).<p>At that size you even need to give up on
    grepping, really. I&#x27;ve written a tiny bash script that uses the fact that
    log lines start with a timestamp and `dd` for immediate extraction. This allows
    me to quickly binary search for the location I&#x27;m interested in.<p>Then I
    can `dd` to dump the region of the file I want. After that I have an little awk
    script that lets me collapse the sql lines (since they break across multiple lines)
    to make grepping really easy.<p>All in all it&#x27;s a handful of old school script
    that makes an almost impossible task easy.

- comment: I disagree with this assessment on  many levels, but I think the most important
    challenge I can make is to the idea that Brewster Kahle is a rogue actor, who
    in some sense mis-interpreted the mission and strategy of the Internet Archive.<p>For
    those of you who are just learning that name from this lawsuit, here&#x27;s his
    wikipedia page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brewster_Kahle"
    rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brewster_Kahle</a><p>Kahle
    founded the Archive in the nineties, in the midst of the fairly determined attempts
    at that time to either delay or even re-engineer the early Internet to be more
    respectful of existing intellectual property and decency laws.<p>We inherit a
    searchable, saveable web, because of the work done then to establish the norm
    that the Internet itself should exist, and that open digital archives <i>can</i>
    exist, legally. Many many people worked on the first issue. But Kahle played a
    far far larger role in the second battle.<p>So these &quot;noble aspects&quot;
    of &quot;real value to society&quot;, as you rightly describe them, came from
    fighting for them -- by rolling them into existence in the face of opposition
    and skepticism.<p>So I understand the concern that this court decision threatens
    the future of some forms of archiving, digital preservation and librarianship.
    But the existing norms and repositories this threatens <i>exist</i> because people
    established those norms and archiving projects before now, in living memory, even
    in the face of threats and lectures about precedent and worries about legal gray
    areas.<p>If you want to defend and protect &quot;the many noble aspects of the
    archive&quot;, you have to remember that thirty years ago, those were imagined
    as impossible, impractical, and (whisper it) probably illegal. In both cases,
    it was Kahle&#x27;s vision and approach that was -- apparently -- the only way
    it was going to get done.<p>So I profoundly disagree that this is somehow a wild
    chase out of the safe and respectable grounds of the Archive&#x27;s core mission.
    The Archive&#x27;s core mission <i>got to be respectable</i> because Kahle chased
    the wild idea, and established its right to exist.<p>That may sound like I&#x27;m
    overstating Kahle&#x27;s role, and&#x2F;or overstating the initially radical,
    now widely-respected nature of pretty much everything the Archive has done.<p>But
    if it&#x27;s not the case -- why is there only one Internet Archive? Why didn&#x27;t
    other people, other national archives, other commercial concerns or non-profits
    join in this work? Why did only Kahle do it, and why was it only Kahle coming
    up with CDL as an idea to prevent the death of first sale, of lending a book,
    of the idea of a free library in a digital future?  There should be more ideas,
    more Internet Archives, of course, for safety&#x27;s sake. But absolutely nothing
    about Kahle&#x27;s mission to create a library of and on the Internet was ever
    &quot;safe&quot;.

    moved so far past where they were originally, the people who work very hard can
    be dead for decades and their works still in copyright, and by the time they are
    dead for 70 years, the copyright will probably be extended again.'

    their launch of the EL is critical [0], right at the moment when HN would be most
    expected to rally to their defense. By the time the lawsuit was actually starting
    to take shape most commenters had become very concerned for the fate of the IA
    [1]. This is on a forum that reliably champions freedom of information, but most
    of us knew even at the time that what they&#x27;d done was <i>extremely</i> unlikely

    contains multiple aspects and might just get upvotes for reasonably looking at
    both sides like in this thread. Being thoughtful, mindful, respecting and trying

    And that&#x27;s just one tiny aspect of why top comment isn&#x27;t necessarily
    the most popular argument. Timing (resulting in more views and possibly upvotes)
    and other facotrs all play a role (not sure how much this is mitigated by the

    This usually means that the legal matter was so clear that the judge didn&#x27;t
    even see a reason to start a trial. This judgement has now been confirmed on appeal.
    Just about any lawyer could have probably told them this was the inevitable outcome
    had they listened.<p>I personally have donated previously to IA but now it frankly
    disgusts me that the project&#x27;s current management has for the last few years

- comment: But that&#x27;s not what this case was about. Throughout the trial they
    have been allowed to provide continued digital access to the scanned books, granted
    they operate like a library (each borrowed book is backed by a physical copy.)
    The case was launched when during the Covid-19 pandemic they removed the limitations
    under the veil of &quot;National Emergency Library&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;internet-archive-responds-why-we-released-the-national-emergency-library&#x2F;"
    rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;internet-archive-respond...</a><p>This
    seemed already at the time completely counter-productive and unnecessary step
    as it basically forced the publishers to react because it made IA&#x27;s digital
    lending indistinguishable from casual e-book piracy.<p>They have now created a
    legal precedent that, <i>in addition</i> to finding the &quot;National Emergency
    Library&quot; illegal, makes the controlled lending they implemented previously
    illegal. Ever since the district court ruling they have been able to continue
    digital lending only by negotiating compensation terms with the publishers.<p>So,
    instead of expanding everyone&#x27;s access to the digital archives, they have
    managed to indefinitely limit it by creating a restricting legal precedent. This
    was the inevitable outcome of &quot;National Emergency Library&quot; and they
    knew or should have known it.

    not how everybody lives. Some people do what they believe is right regardless
    of the consequences. They will fight fights they are guaranteed to lose. Not because
    it makes sense but because <i>that&#x27;s who they are</i>. The people who get
    mad that idealists fight losing battles tend not to be pragmatic fighters for
    change but people who will <i>never fight at all</i> because &quot;it&#x27;s just
    not worth it&quot; or &quot;the risk&#x2F;reward doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot;.
    Idealism doesn&#x27;t make rational sense. Idealists mostly just lose. But the

    Especially when the cause (challenging how copyright law works) is one you support.<p>I
    don&#x27;t think so. IA is a valuable resource for the Wayback Machine and other
    endeavors which are far more seated in fair use or preservation. Choosing to sacrifice
    the rest of IA for a grandiose or idealized vision of how the world <i>should</i>
    work is a betrayal of those who donate to IA in hopes of funding the much more
    tangible goal. If he wanted to take the stance he took, he should have spun the
    library component out of IA and served it as a separate legal entity to take on
    that risk.<p>Maybe the community trust in IA has been misplaced. The mission on
    their website clearly says they want to serve &quot;All Knowledge&quot; but I&#x27;m
    not alone in thinking it would be best for them to narrow their scope to just
    internet-related things, and specifically, things that aren&#x27;t served by other
    archive or library sources.<p>IA is <i>currently</i> used to host and distribute
    large quantities of software, games, and other media in a quasi-legal mindset
    that is truly not something that is easily justified. Is having every Xbox 360
    ISO publicly available for download on IA really serving the same mission as archiving
    all of the random blogs people have written on the internet? Is serving in-copyright
    published books?<p>I think the problem is that IA has multiple missions that all
    compete, and broadly, people assumed that they would act in a way that wouldn&#x27;t
    jeopardize the rest of the archive.'

    but by the very nature of said goals (amongst others, preservation and archival
    of knowledge), they have to be even more prudent and have stability as one of
    their most important goals imo. Like, every goal they have becomes completely
    impossible to achieve without a very stable, long term outlook. &quot;Hitting
    and missing&quot; is usually fine, but it&#x27;s an attitude that is more reminiscent
    of wallstreetbets than a serious knowledge repository that aims to preserve everything
    they can for at least a few generations.<p>To push the wallstreetbets analogy
    further, a hedge fund that bets on something risky and loses big is fine. But
    you don&#x27;t just &quot;hit and miss&quot; at a large scale when you are in
    charge of  trillions in retirement&#x2F;pension funds. It just should not be part
    of the thought process in the first place, it&#x27;s the completely wrong mindset.<p>Not

    up a non-transformative service that is substantially equivalent to competing
    ebook services and CDLs, but unlike those it is not paying the customary price
    to publishers.<p>It also discusses that there is a very good reason why digital
    libraries don&#x27;t typically get to have perpetual rights to a work at the retail
    (or used) price for a print book. Basically, physical books wear out with use,
    ebooks don&#x27;t, so there&#x27;s a built-in mechanism for revenue recurrence
    that happens with print books but not ebooks. The ruling points out that publishers
    originally sold ebooks to libraries at the same pricing as print books, but abandoned
    the practice because they discovered that it was not financially sustainable.<p>And
    that&#x27;s ultimately where the harm comes in. The IA is trying to create a loophole
    that subverts the income stream of all the people who work on a book by offering
    derivative works - which are never fair use; fair use is for <i>transformative</i>
    works - without paying the market&#x27;s customary price for acquiring rights
    to create and distribute derivative works.<p>(As an aside, when I see authors
    speaking for themselves on these sorts of issues they will typically point out
    that editors and typesetters and cover artists and all the other folks who work
    on a book also deserve to get paid. It seems to only be people who are tokenizing
    authors for rhetorical purposes who want fixate on authors specifically and erase
    the value-adding contributions of &quot;the publishers&quot;.)

    there&#x27;s a built-in mechanism for revenue recurrence that happens with print
    books but not ebooks.<p>As someone who understands the ruling and why IA lost
    completely, I still hate this argument, because it gets the history backwards.
    When first sale was put into (case)law, ebooks didn&#x27;t exist. First sale doesn&#x27;t
    exist because &quot;oh, well, the book wears out eventually&quot;. It exists because
    you have an ownership interest in that copy of the book and copyright law has
    to respect your physical ownership of that property. Once you have sold a copy,
    your rights as a copyright owner are exhausted.<p>With digital distribution, the
    law decided that, no, there is no rights exhaustion whatsoever. And this is mainly
    because the technology was made after the law was horrifically unbalanced (or
    <i>re</i>-balanced) in favor of large publishers. CDL absolutely has no leg to
    stand on in the courts, but it is the sort of thing that would make sense as the
    legal basis for a new rights exhaustion regime that was properly legislated in
    Congress.<p>&gt; As an aside, when I see authors speaking for themselves on these
    sorts of issues they will typically point out that editors and typesetters and
    cover artists and all the other folks who work on a book also deserve to get paid.
    It seems to only be people who are tokenizing authors for rhetorical purposes
    who want fixate on authors specifically and erase the value-adding contributions
    of &quot;the publishers&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve talked about the habit of copyright
    reformists &#x2F; abolitionists ignoring the &quot;creative working class&quot;
    in the past. The headline artist on a work is most likely to be able to survive
    off non-royalty income because they have social capital that the creative working
    class does not. On the other hand, publishing firms don&#x27;t give a shit about
    the creative working class either! A lot of media companies are run by people
    who think generative AI is going to let them eliminate entire classes of creative
    labor and replace it with ChatGPT prompts.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure referencing
    the opinions of headline artists helps either. In contrast to (but not negating)
    what you&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve heard authors complain endlessly about publishers,
    too. Things like, oh, we don&#x27;t want to fund the third book in your trilogy,
    but we also aren&#x27;t going to let you trip the rights reversion clause in your
    contract, so you just can&#x27;t finish the story. Shit like that. Publishers&#x27;
    valuations are based at least in part on their total IP catalog, so a work they
    don&#x27;t want to touch anymore is worth more to them dead than alive.'

- comment: The ruling&#x27;s section on transformativeness explains the distinction.
    Note that &quot;derivative works&quot; under US copyright law works differently
    from how it gets defined in typical open source licenses.<p>My understanding is
    that, for the purposes of determining fair use, a derivative work is substantially
    the same thing but in a different format. Transformative work must involve significant
    additional creative contribution &quot;Changing the medium of a work is a derivative
    use rather than a transformative one.&quot; They cite previous case law that holds
    repackaging a print book as an e-book as a &quot;paradigmatic example of a derivative
    work.&quot; The law also offers some paradigmatic examples of transformative work,
    such as criticism, commentary and scholarship.<p>Based on all of that, I would
    guess that, for the purposes of copyright law, a JPEG of a painting is absolutely
    a derivative work and not a transformative one.

    \ the case stemming from the IA&#x27;s National Emergency Library (NEL) initiative\
    \ during the COVID-19 pandemic, which allowed users to access digitized books\
    \ without the usual lending caps.\nThis prompted the lawsuit from several major\
    \ publishers, who argued that this violated copyright law.\nThe appeals court\
    \ rejected the IA&#x27;s argument that its activities fell under the &quot;fair\
    \ use&quot; doctrine, specifically noting that the IA digital library acted as\
    \ a substitute for original books, depriving publishers and authors of revenue.\
    \ \nWhile the court acknowledged that the Internet Archive&#x27;s activities were\
    \ non-commercial in nature, it still concluded that the wide availability of digitized\
    \ books due to unregulated replication harmed the market for the original works.\n\
    This decision has significant implications for the IA\u2019s future operations,\
    \ potentially limiting its ability to continue its broad digitization efforts\
    \ without publisher consent. \nThe ruling reinforces the legal rights of publishers\
    \ and authors to control the reproduction and distribution of their works, even\
    \ in digital formats. \nThe Internet Archive has few remaining legal options,\
    \ with the Supreme Court being one of its last possible avenues for appeal. \n\
    Meanwhile, the organization faces additional lawsuits related to its music digitization\
    \ efforts, those litigations are ongoing.\nThe ruling today highlights a broader\
    \ conflict between the rights of creators and the push for wider public access\

    huge publishers.<p>It makes sense to me that a digital library poses an existential
    threat to the business model of those large publishers who have gradually moved
    away from obtaining or encouraging the creation of new original works (the original
    intention of copyright) to reselling and repackaging existing content over and
    over again. This is why things like DRM exist, not to prevent piracy, but one
    one many mechanisms serving this strategy by controlling how ordinary consumers
    can consume what they &quot;bought&quot;, when, where, on what, for how long...
    so many types of restrictions all serving to extract the maximum economic return
    for each original piece of work they own - A library completely undermines that
    strategy, because it necessarily removes most of those mechanisms to function.'

    interests by breaking laws, they counter-sue, often frivolously.<p>They also lobby.<p>Breaking
    laws and then arguing to change them when caught doesn&#x27;t work and almost
    no one does it. The cost in money and time to get to higher courts, win (uncertain
    probability) and create a precedent with a legal department is 10x-1000x the cost
    of lobbying congress to pass a bill. The big tech corporate lawsuits that go to
    appeals are so expensive that one could probably straight up bribe influential
    politicians for less, should that be the path one wished to take. We know stories
    where people went to higher courts and won to create a precedent because these
    stories are heroic and rare.<p>If IA had the resources of Uber it wouldn&#x27;t

- comment: '&gt; The copyright goalposts have moved so far past where they were originally,
    the people who work very hard can be dead for decades and their works still in
    copyright, and by the time they are dead for 70 years<p>Note that copyright lasting
    50 years after the author&#x27;s death was already in Berne Convention from 1886.
    Some (but not all) of these extensions in US were just adaptation of older weaker
    US copyright to international conventions.'

    to have to convince people, you can&#x27;t just wave your degrees and resume around.<p>Maybe
    this was true in the 1950s and 60s, but a lot of things enshrined by judicial
    or executive fiat already have democratic support. ex: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1431&#x2F;"
    rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1431&#x2F;</a> Tearing them down
    is just an exercise in vetocracy.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this relates
    to copyright, though - an aspect of law whose main impact on the average person
    is YouTube or Facebook saying &quot;no, you can&#x27;t put 50 year old pop songs
    on your uploads&quot;. Here, the problem isn&#x27;t a majority opposition that
    needs to be convinced, it&#x27;s a majority that <i>doesn&#x27;t care</i>, or
    doesn&#x27;t know how to fight in favor of reform.<p>IA won&#x27;t be gone because
    libraries have limitations on copyright damages. In fact, they already paid damages
    in a settlement with the publishers in the lawsuit. The only reason why there
    even is an appeal being talked about is because IA and the publishers both agreed
    to keep the case live through the appeals court.'

    think the demographic of &quot;people buying (your) books&quot; and &quot;people
    borrowing (your) books from a library&quot; have that much overlap.<p>People who
    borrow books from a library are usually people who either don&#x27;t want to (or
    can&#x27;t) buy all the books they like to read. In that case they are unlikely
    to buy the book anyway even if they can&#x27;t find it in the library... OTOH
    people who love your books or your writings, or people who saw a review and think
    &quot;I&#x27;d like to read that book&quot; will buy it anyway and not read a
    scanned version of it on their small phone screen.<p>I mean I understand why authors
    would love it if libraries didn&#x27;t exist and everyone had to buy the book
    to read it, I would probably be in the same boat if I were an author. But the
    calculation &quot;1 borrowed book = 1 lost sale&quot; is flawed the same way that

    their software library.<p>Most of it is actually supplied by ordinary users unrelated
    to Internet Archive with little to no oversight or curation. I have no idea how
    effective reporting is, but I would bet it&#x27;s not meaningful given the prevailing
    prevalence of warez.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve downloaded some of those warez and they
    have all worked.<p>I would advise not white knighting for Internet Archive and
    instead judge them for what they actually are.<p>I honestly think the software
    library is actually a far bigger liability risk than the book piracy scheme. Software
    developers and publishers are just as vindicative as book authors and publishers
    if you paint a big enough target on your stupid ass and there&#x27;s a lot more
    dollars at play.

- comment: So, this case was not about CDL (Controlled Digital Lending).  It was about
    DL with the &quot;C&quot; removed.  Specifically the IA&#x27;s previous CDL program
    only lent out one electronic copy at a time per physical copy held, and this case
    is about a program at beginning of pandemic where they suspended these limits.<p>There
    could still be appeals in store for this case, but regardless of the outcome of
    this case, CDL could still be quite legal (and I think ought to be -- libraries
    ability to lend out books without publisher permission or license has been a huge
    gain for society, and I think must be able to continue in the electronic realm;
    and I think there are good legal arguments for it, on extension of first-sale
    doctrine to electronic realm and on fair use).<p>It was not helpful for the case
    of CDL to have this pretty bad (&quot;uncontrolled digital lending&quot;?) case
    decided first though, I agree this was not a very strategic move.

    related to whether the digitization involved in CDL is &quot;transformative&quot;
    that rests on official publisher eBooks being available, but there&#x27;s a strong

    a bad case that ruined CDL, where maybe a better case with better facts would

    though.<p>I&#x27;ve thought since the beginning of this saga that a change in
    statute would pretty much be needed for CDL or something similar. The idea being
    to craft something that extends the philosophy or idea of libraries in the face
    of an increasingly digital world where doing much of anything requires a copy,
    things are licensed rather than sold, and the first sale doctrine has little application,
    but I agree with you that such an idea has dim prospects.

    the publishers never bothered to make available for eBooks licensing.  It&#x27;s
    at least reasonable to expect that the fair-use analysis might tilt the other
    way for such books - the use is a bit more &quot;transformative&quot; because
    at least it technically contributes something that the publisher didn&#x27;t,

    The findings in the case showed that IA had lost complete control of the physical
    book so at that point they were simply breaking copyright. Add in that they steered
    people to their own used book store, and this case never had a chance.

- comment: 'I think you misunderstand the situation. If you haven&#x27;t read the
    lawsuit [1] I suggest you look through it.<p>Basically, there is an established
    practice for lending printed books: the library buys a book and lends it to patrons
    without permission from the copyright owner.<p>However, publishers believe that
    digital books are different from physical books and established practice doesn&#x27;t
    apply to them; they believe that lending should be made at publishers&#x27; terms,
    to be specific:<p>- only &quot;academic libraries&quot; (chosen by publishers)
    may lend digital books<p>- they may lend them only to the members, for example,
    only students of the university, not to random people<p>- library must buy a special
    &quot;library license&quot;, which might have arbitrary price and arbitrary terms<p>-
    the license has a limited term: sometimes it is 1-2 years, sometimes it is 26
    lendings, after which the library must purchase a new license<p>- the library
    must use publishers-approved DRM which might not work on some devices<p>To enforce
    these rules publishers use DRM that prevents anyone from buying a digital book
    and lending it to other person (which was possible with digital books). So, in
    publishers view new technology means new rules and new opportunities.<p>The IA
    found a workaround: they bought physical books, scanned them and lent those digital
    copies instead of a physical book, provided that only one user can read the same
    book at the same time. They acted like a library but using remote access to a
    digital copy. The lender might read the book on IA&#x27;s website enforcing the
    terms of use or download a DRM-protected PDF.<p>The lawsuit is about whether IA
    actions are legal or not (i.e. if digital books may be lent like physical books).
    Given that in future there will be less and less physical books, if publishers
    win, it will mean that libraries will not be able to lend contemporary books at
    the same terms and costs they lent physical books.<p>There are several complications:
    dubious partnerships by IA with libraries to increase the number of lent simultaneously
    copies; dubious decision to remove limits during COVID pandemic. However, there
    are facts that play in IA favour: there are precedents when making digital copies
    was considered legal (by Google Books), and there are a 17 US Code 108 [2] and
    109 [3], which allows some exemptions from copyright for libraries and archives.<p>[1]

- comment: What you describe as lending a digital copy, is making new copies. As a
    matter of engineering fact, the bytes were copied from one location to another;
    as a matter of black-letter law, that is making a copy in the sense that it is
    copyright infringement to do so without a license. That IA &#x27;controlled&#x27;
    it to have only one outstanding copy at a time in hands other than theirs does
    not make it legal. The carveout saying libraries can make three copies does not
    cover them making hundreds.<p>If IA would <i>like</i> five dozen copies to be
    morally equivalent to one copy as long as they ask each person who received one
    to swear they deleted it before IA makes another, they can call their congressman
    and ask them to propose a copyright law amendment. They did not do this, and instead
    just knowingly violated the law repeatedly. Wailing about how libraries won&#x27;t
    exist in the future is silly, because it just takes reforming the law to fix this,
    but IA seemed to be under the impression that as long as the rules would one day
    be amended, they could act as though they&#x27;re already amended that way today.

    without &quot;fixing&quot; it permanently where &quot;fixing&quot; is defined
    in 17 US Code 101. And we use it to view books from a remote server. In this case
    it seems like we are not making a &quot;copy&quot;; we simply let user watch book
    stored on our server. So this should be legal?

    actually better because it allows people from remote areas to access the books,
    it allows lending books at night, so it makes using the library more convenient,
    saves user&#x27;s time and library&#x27;s money.<p>Also, copying is ok in some
    cases; for example, the court found that Google scanning books for Google Books
    did it legally; 17 US Code 108 and 109 provide some exemptions from copyright.

- comment: The decision is that lending of digital books causes &quot;market harm
    for the publishers&quot;. It outweighs anything else. So the court only cares
    about profits of publishers and not right of the buyers, including &quot;first-sale
    doctrine&quot; and right to lend a legally obtained book. The court sees the case
    as merely making illegal copies and doesn&#x27;t want to make analogies with libraries
    lending out books. It is obvious.<p>You can apply most of those arguments to a
    library lending out (distributing) physical books without authorization and causing
    same harm to the publisher.

    because using them requires &quot;technical&quot; copying. Moving them requires
    copying, using them requires copying, lending them requires copying. The law as
    written means that digital works will give their buyer far fewer rights than identical
    physical copies of the same. And yes, that&#x27;s precisely why the current law
    is bananas, because it turns digitization into an excuse to enclose the commons.
    But I have no confidence in the courts to stop it, because that&#x27;s not what
    courts do.

    these works in a completely indiscriminate manner. Curation is important. Even
    assuming, for the sake of argument, that we <i>could</i> keep everything forever,
    actually doing so would ultimately harm the value of the archive, due to Sturgeon&#x27;s
    Law. The truth is that the vast majority of cultural output is of only ephemeral
    value. It&#x27;s relevant to a place and a time, but not necessarily great enough
    to also be interesting to people from a different place and a future time.<p>And
    I&#x27;ve only got a little bit of time in this life; I&#x27;d much rather read
    a trashy romance novel that was written this year and meant to entertain me than
    the trashy romance with politics that make me cringe that my mom was reading 50
    years ago.<p>This is why, for example, the Library of Congress doesn&#x27;t just
    keep a copy of everything. It&#x27;s not just a space constraints or storage costs
    issue; it&#x27;s a signal-to-noise ratio issue. As Mark Crislip is fond of saying,
    when you mix apple pie and cow pie it doesn&#x27;t make the cow pie better, it

    defense, finding that its digital lending practices merely substitute for and
    do not transform the original copyrighted works.<p>2. IA&#x27;s activities are
    likely to cause significant market harm to publishers&#x27; e-book and digital
    licensing businesses, which outweighs any public benefits of expanded access.<p>3.
    Allowing widespread unauthorized digital copying and distribution, even by a nonprofit,
    would undermine the fundamental purpose of copyright law to incentivize creative
    expression.<p>4. The ruling highlights the tension between expanding public access
    to knowledge and preserving authors&#x27; and publishers&#x27; exclusive rights
    over their works, which copyright law is meant to balance.<p>5. The decision sets
    an important precedent limiting the ability of digital libraries and archives
    to widely distribute copyrighted works online without permission, even if the
    intent is to increase public access.<p>-Kagi Sum

    So IA&#x27;s position is that you can treat digital books like physical books,
    i.e. re-sell them or lend. The only difference is that they don&#x27;t require
    you to come to library in person.<p>Publishers position is that digital books
    are different from physical; you have no right to re-sell or lend it without publisher&#x27;s

    a movie, you normally get a &quot;home viewing&quot; license. That does <i>not</i>
    give you the right to show it at your business (even if you don&#x27;t charge
    money and only 10 people come).<p>There&#x27;s also a Public Performance Rights
    (PPR) license, and I always had to get PPR&#x27;s because Google lawyers would
    shut us down otherwise. PPR costs considerably more than a home viewing license.<p>When
    I negotiated PPR&#x27;s, they always asked three questions:<p>1. How many in the
    audience?<p>2. Are you charging money?<p>3. Are you advertising this outside Google?<p>If
    I were a movie theater taking $15 a head from anyone who showed up, my PPR would
    cost a lot more.<p>It seems that what IA wants is to use home viewing rights as
    though they had PPR&#x27;s.<p>&quot;No, they don&#x27;t!&quot; you retort? You
    might be right, but asking AG to design a license for them would be a lot more

    thing I forgot to add: lawyers always prefer to start with their own draft. We

- comment: It is ultimately judgment calls by human beings that make the determinations.
    However, I don&#x27;t see how you can read this opinion and think that the judges
    are just making their minds up on the spot. Every single decision point in this
    opinion goes back to prior cases and either explains why they apply or distinguishes
    this case from them to explain why they don&#x27;t.<p>- It&#x27;s not like Campbell&#x2F;Rose-Acuff
    (2 Live Crew v Roy Orbison, the &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; case) because IA&#x27;s
    ebooks are not parodies of the original works. They _are_ the original works.<p>-
    It&#x27;s not like Sony (the Betamax case in which whole-work copying was found
    fair because it enabled time-shifting), because there&#x27;s no sufficiently different
    use that&#x27;s not supported by the original copy. You read the book, you read
    the IA scanned copy.<p>Courts have judgment, but within parameters. The Copyright
    Act itself spells out four factors for evaluating whether a use is fair, and both
    courts found that it failed on every factor. The judge can&#x27;t say, &quot;well,
    but I still believe that the use should be fair anyway&quot;; that would be an
    instant reversal and remand, with instructions amounting to &quot;follow what
    the law says, dummy.&quot;<p>This was never really a close call based on prior
    cases. Transformative use has almost never been &quot;exactly the same work used
    exactly the same way, but digital.&quot; Cases that have tried to make that argument
    have failed again and again. The &quot;our enforcement ensures that only one person
    is using the copy at a time&quot; has been tried before as well, and has consistently
    failed. Back in 2020, my heart sank when I saw IA&#x27;s announcement that they
    were doing this, because I was certain that they would be sued for it, and that
    they would lose if they were. I can&#x27;t stress enough how obvious these rulings
    have been if you expect the courts to do what they ordinarily do-- find similarly
    in similar cases.<p>The Supreme Court can discard all that precedent - they&#x27;ve
    certainly made a habit of that lately - and create new case law, along with an
    explanation of the way that they evaluate the factors to find that way. They may
    in fact do so; they&#x27;ve done that a couple of times in recent decades. However,
    they don&#x27;t take many cases, and this case is so clearly in line with past
    cases that it&#x27;s hard to see why they would take this one.

    new provisions for anti-circumvention and for safe harbor, but it didn&#x27;t
    add new exemptions that most people care about, or modify the exclusive rights
    in any way.]<p>The entertainment&#x2F;publishing industries have usually gotten

    works in the same way it does to physical works, and whether it _does_ apply to
    physical works under current law.<p>I&#x27;m teetering at the top of a very tall
    fence on the _should_ question.<p>Publishers have always been opposed to digital
    first sale for a very simple reason: fear that their prices will go to zero. Used
    physical books prices are pennies on the dollar for new book prices, on the basis
    of the condition&#x2F;deterioration issue. The quality&#x2F;condition issue doesn&#x27;t
    exist for digital works. If Amazon could offer &quot;used&quot; digital copies
    of publisher e-books, the customer would be choosing between identical binaries
    at 10-1 price ratios _at best_. I really don&#x27;t see any other way that this
    goes. Sure, capitalism isn&#x27;t for the weak, yadda yadda, new models, but how&#x27;s
    it going to work. Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Unlimited is an alternate model, but Amazon
    already has enormous control over publisher fortunes. &quot;Should the current
    publishers exist&quot; is a really interesting question. I&#x27;m just not sure
    I want to find out by handing all compensated book publishing to Amazon.<p>So
    why am I on the fence? Well, I have paid for 2000+ ebooks. I wouldn&#x27;t mind
    being able to transfer them to my children without limitation, or to friends.
    If there were a resale mechanism no more disruptive than used paper books, I would
    probably have sold some of them already. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t appreciate
    the value or convenience of resale, but that I consider the side effects.<p>The
    second question is, &quot;Does current law support digital first sale?&quot; First
    off, I am not a lawyer, and I&#x27;m not giving legal advice. However, the words
    of the law are pretty damn clear, to be honest, that it does not. You found section
    109, which is correct, but you&#x27;re relying on the colloquial meaning of the
    word &quot;copy.&quot; You need to look up the words &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;phonorecord&quot;
    in the definitions, section 101, so that you can see that in this law both words
    refer to _material objects_ in which a work is fixed.<p>A paper book is a material
    object. You can sell the book. The buyer owns the physical book - the stack of
    paper and binding - and can read it.<p>A CD or DVD is a material object. You can
    sell the flashy mirror thing. The buyer owns the flashy mirror thing and can listen
    to the album or play the movie.<p>An ebook is just not a material object. In most
    cases, they are not with a single physical object, but licensed as downloads according
    to fairly restrictive terms. If you have a physical object with a duly licensed
    ebook on it, you&#x27;re probably allowed to sell that physical object (unless
    it&#x27;s a Cybertruck, I guess.) However, the license on that download is still
    going to be what controls. Your Kindle has Kindle software tied to your Amazon
    account that allows you to read the books you&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m really
    pretty certain you can&#x27;t sell your Amazon account and all your individual
    access rights.<p>Various entrepreneurs have tried to convince courts that some
    variant of &quot;one-copy-at-a-time&quot; digital first sale tech fits under 109,
    and courts look for the material object and note that it is not there.<p>So, anyway,
    the law is not written so that ingenious digital technology that ensures that
    a digital copy is only possessed by one person at time can fall under first sale.
    It&#x27;s written so that physical objects that contain or embody copyright-protected
    works can be sold.'

    However, there&#x27;s a ton of legal precedent for lending out purchased physical
    copies of things. Certainly there&#x27;s no precedent for the unlimited lending
    that triggered the current legal woes. Previously a lot of what the IA didn&#x27;t

    example if copyright law would prevent you from repairing your device (like you
    need to put a coprighted image of an Xbox logo on your hard disk for it to be

    )<p>From Wikipedia:<p>&gt; The Ninth Circuit did, however, overturn the district
    court&#x27;s decision that Google&#x27;s thumbnail images were unauthorized and
    infringing copies of Perfect 10&#x27;s original images. Google&#x27;s claimed
    that these images constituted fair use, and the circuit court agreed. This was
    because they were &quot;highly transformative.&quot; The court did not define
    what size a thumbnail should be but the examples the court cited was only 3% of
    the size of the original images. Most other major sites use a size not longer
    than 150 pixels on the long side. Specifically, the court ruled that Google transformed
    the images from a use of entertainment and artistic expression to one of retrieving
    information, citing the precedent Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation. The court
    reached this conclusion despite the fact that Perfect 10 was attempting to market
    thumbnail images for cell phones, with the court quipping that the &quot;potential
    harm to Perfect 10&#x27;s market remains hypothetical.&quot;<p>&gt; The court
    pointed out that Google made available to the public the new and highly beneficial
    function of &quot;improving access to [pictorial] information on the Internet.&quot;
    This had the effect of recognizing that &quot;search engine technology provides
    an astoundingly valuable public benefit, which should not be jeopardized just
    because it might be used in a way that could affect somebody&#x27;s sales.<p>If
    resizing an image to a fraction of the size of the original is sufficiently transformative
    and useful for a different thing (image search rather than selling thumbnails
    for cellphone porn) is considered fair use, then direct parallels could be drawn
    from that ruling to OpenAI&#x27;s use of copyrighted material being sufficiently
    transformative and irrespective of someone selling summaries of a copyrighted
    work.<p>---<p>If you believe that OpenAI and other LLMs are infringing and not
    covered by fair use, it would be helpful if you could write a bit on how they
    fail at the four tests of fair use described in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fairuse.stanford.edu&#x2F;overview&#x2F;fair-use&#x2F;four-factors&#x2F;"

    before of IA, I was told that that was ridiculous since the publishers had it
    out for IA before the COVID-19 emergency library. That may or may not have been
    true, but the publishers did not sue IA despite OpenLibrary existing for years
    before COVID-19. Publishers didn&#x27;t pull the trigger because they were afraid
    of losing. It was a MAD situation, and IA unnecessarily triggered a nuclear war
    that they lost.'

    the top of this thread (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41447904">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41447904</a>)
    is: the scan is a derivative and copyright law lets you lend books, not derivative
    works thereof<p>Which seems like a nitpicky distinction to me when it&#x27;s the
    same words on the same page and they&#x27;re not shown to anyone else at the same
    time... but such is a judge&#x27;s job as opposed to a legislator'

- comment: No, because digital works aren&#x27;t &quot;sold&quot;, they&#x27;re licensed.  Even
    if the IA did the scanning themselves, the laws are written such that a scan isn&#x27;t
    like a physical object.  You can only own a revokeable license to view it and
    aren&#x27;t allowed to do anything else.  No transformative works.  No transfer
    of the works.  No fair use.<p>This is why local libraries are getting bled by
    their e-book subscriptions.  They end up paying through the nose for people to
    check out e-books.

    to lend (digitally or physically), they now have two copies of the book and have
    committed copyright infringement. As soon as they lend a copy, there are now three
    copies in existence (unless they delete their copy as part of the loan) which
    is another count of infringement.

    the original on the server as it was sending it and the person returning the book
    also transferred the bytes back it would be quite a show.<p>I&#x27;m about 95%
    sure a scheme like that would still find them shut down.  Remember the Aereo decision?  They
    went through similar contortions, including building an antenna farm with thousands
    of tiny individual antennas, and were immediately killed off by the courts because
    it was seen as a legal hack.  Such a scheme might threaten cable TV income if
    it were allowed to stand.  Protecting incumbents from competition is a vital role

    It&#x27;s challenging to copy physical items (you have to photocopy every page
    which few people do) and you can&#x27;t do it verbatim (you can&#x27;t make a
    &#x27;clone&#x27; of the book, it will always be an inferior reproduction). It&#x27;s
    more straightforward to remove DRM, and you then have a 1:1 unrestricted copy.<p>*
    Library books deteriorate with use and get lost, meaning there will always be
    the possibility for further revenue, particularly with popular items.<p>* Physical
    lending is not governed by software interlocks; software which may not be capable
    of being inspected or audited by the publisher.

    They were effectively letting one person effectively remotely view a physical

    Their &quot;transformation&quot; argument comes down to easing access, which has
    already been shot down in previous cases; unsurprising, since Napster could make
    the same argument.<p>* Their &quot;nature of the work&quot; argument came down
    to the fact that some of the books they scanned were nonfiction.<p>* They made
    a halfhearted attempt to claim that &quot;amount and substantiality&quot; weighed
    neutrally in this case, despite copying entire books wholesale and making them
    available in their entirety.<p>* They brought experts to make their &quot;commercial
    impact&quot; argument who limited their analysis to physical books(?!) despite
    the publishers coming to the case with competing ebooks.<p>It&#x27;s wild to me
    they thought they could win this case. There&#x27;s the law as people at IA and
    on message boards want it to be, and there&#x27;s the law as it is. For people
    who want those two concepts to come closer together, this case seems like a major

    personally make an effort to use the best OSS LLMs available first (i.e. from

- comment: Except they can&#x27;t do the equivalent for art yet either, and I am fairly
    familiar with the state of image diffusion today.<p>I&#x27;ve commissioned tens
    of thousands of dollars in art, and spent thousands of hours working with Stable
    Diffusion, Midjourney, and Flux. What all the generators are missing is <i>intentionality</i>
    in art.<p>They can generate something that looks great at surface level, but doesn&#x27;t
    make sense when you look at the details. Why is a particular character wearing
    a certain bracelet? Why do the windows on that cottage look a certain way? What
    does the engraving mean in this elaborate knife design I am generating?<p>The
    diffusers do not understand what they are generating, so they just generates what
    &quot;looks right.&quot; Often this results in art that looks pretty but has no
    deeper logic, world building, meaning, etc.<p>And of course, image generators
    cannot handle the client-artist relationship as well (even LLMs cannot), because
    it requires an understanding of what the customer wants and what emotion they
    want to convey with the piece they&#x27;re commissioning.<p>So - I rely on artists
    for art I care about, and image generators for throwaway work (like weekly D&amp;D
    campaign images.)

- comment: Because code either works or it doesn&#x27;t. Nobody is replacing our entire
    income stream with an LLM.<p>You also need a knowledge of code to instruct an
    LLM to generate decent code, and even then it&#x27;s not always perfect.<p>Meanwhile
    plenty of people are using free&#x2F;cheap image generation and going &quot;good
    enough&quot;. Now they don&#x27;t need to pay a graphic artist or a stock photo
    licence<p>Any layperson can describe what they want a picture to look like so
    the barrier to entry and successful exit is a lot lower for LLM image generation
    than for LLM code generation.

    they work with medium that&#x27;s not digital in the first place, but the range

    setting up these small LLMs like Yi-Coder locally for tab completion? Does it

    what tools or steps are you all using to get them working on your projects? Any

    Well, yes. The timing and unique request path make identifying possible. And CSS
    can be dropped in context by other users, crafted to refer to a different domain,
    so CSS worms can definitely ex-filtrate data without the webmaster being evil.'

    users disable JS, or use NoScript to selectively enable JS. My understanding is
    that this is (1) because JS engines are often themselves a source of vulnerabilities,
    (2) untrusted code execution might be risky in the face of speculation execution&#x2F;access
    attacks.<p>Do such users need to worry about either, or both, with such advanced,
    compute-y CSS primitives?

- comment: Imo, those are <i>security</i> reasons to disable JS. The main <i>privacy</i>
    reason (again, imo) to disable JS is simply that JS can just send each and every
    one of your inputs to the server.<p>But as lelandfe points out, CSS can do that,
    too, for form and mouse&#x2F;touch inputs at least. So the main difference is
    that JS tracking is ubiquitous, and CSS tracking is very rare afaik.<p>(This isn&#x27;t
    a response to the question about whether speculative execution attacks are possible,
    sorry.)

    accurate. If you&#x27;re using a VPN, I believe JS can leak your real IP, but
    I&#x27;m not positive about that. There&#x27;s also a big chunk of zero-day attack
    surface that&#x27;s gone. Obviously they can&#x27;t do in-browser bidding scripts

- comment: 'CSS is absolutely debuggable, every browser has dev tools just for this
    very thing.<p>To do this, you can add or remove rules, or change the values of
    variables.<p>Something that might be a source of confusion for you is that CSS
    isn&#x27;t an imperative language, it&#x27;s a declarative language.<p>If you&#x27;re
    not aware of the distinction:<p>- Declarative languages describe what they want
    the output to be but doesn&#x27;t go through every single step on how to create
    the output. (e.g. html, css, regex, sql, nix, etc...)<p>- Imperative languages
    describe every single step on how to create an output, but not what the output
    actually is. (e.g. js&#x2F;ts, php, go, c++, rust, etc...)<p>Since CSS is declarative,
    it doesn&#x27;t have imperative steps on how to draw things (e.g. calculate a
    bunch of co-ords, then loop through all pixels between the co-ords while setting
    their pixel values to #0000FF). Instead we describe what we want (.box { background-color:
    blue }) and leave it up to the browser to decide how to do it.<p>This has several
    advantages from a web browsing perspective:<p>If someone figures out a better
    way to draw a blue box then every website developer doesn&#x27;t need to go back
    and change their box drawing code. Instead, the browser developers change their
    box drawing code and now every website is automatically upgraded at the same time.<p>A
    browser might also make decisions on which way to draw a box. It might loop through
    each pixel one-at-a-time on a cheap cpu-only device, whereas it might pass some
    info to the GPU and have its shaders draw the blue box, or it might use some clever
    heuristics to determine that the blue box is above a large box that already has
    the same blue so there&#x27;s no need to draw over the same space a second time.<p>There
    are other advantages to declarative languages too. Typically around being able
    to specify constraints to eliminate certain problems in the design of the language
    itself (e.g. race conditions, side-effects, indeterminate states, halting problem,
    etc...).<p>In the end, you want to use the language paradigm that makes the most
    sense for the situation at hand.<p>For scripting: you want imperative languages.<p>For
    information and presentation: you want declarative languages.'

- comment: well technically the selectors cascade, so that when you have a selector
    that overrides another one the variable value you set in that selector takes precedence,
    the cool thing being that the variable is of course not just set for its element
    but also the subtree under the element.<p>Since there are lots of ways to do this
    kind of thing, pseudo selectors, attr function etc. the ability to do dynamic
    and complex things from CSS, or with just CSS and HTML combined is pretty big,
    but as a general rule if you want to do this kind of thing statefully it is probably
    best to do it in JS - maintaining what variable values are in play on a particular
    element by setting it that way.

    I&#x27;d argue more of the general hatred comes from people naively expecting

    implementation details. It&#x27;s evident in the UX designers (hopefully of the

    Instead of just a raw value, like:<p><pre><code>    360deg

    variables. A place I used it a while back was a little experiment where I tweaked
    youtube&#x27;s design to look &quot;neon&quot; -- eg all the lines and stuff were
    bright red and glowed. I designed it so the hue of the primary colour was controlled
    by a single css variable. I then thought why not make this extra insane and animate
    the hue slowly through the spectrum so that the colour of the page is changing
    slowly in the background! Apparently you can&#x27;t animate a css variable without
    @property. So it&#x27;s not just letting you use a css variable instead of a raw
    value, it&#x27;s letting you animate the css variable -- and, in turn, all the
    places that css variable is referenced! So with one simple `@keyframes neon-flow
    { from { --dc-neon-hue: 0; } to { --dc-neon-hue: 360; } }`, I animate everything
    -- all the primary colours, all the box shadows, etc.<p>`inherits: false` lets
    you control how the property is inherited. For example, in normal css, the property
    `color: red` is inherited. If you set it on a div, all elements in the div will
    have `color:red` unless they specifically override it. But, say the property `display:
    flex` does not behave this way. If I set it on the div, only the div becomes display
    flex. This is exposing the ability to control how your custom property is inherited
    -- like `color` (`inherits: true`) or like `display` (`inherits: false`).<p>I
    believe the type is there so that it can at static time know what to animate.
    Since a css variable can be anything, unlike a css property. E.g. `from { color:
    red } to {color: blue}` it knows the types because of the properties. With css
    variables, it needs to be told what the types are.<p>Added fun fact: the type
    syntax is actually the same syntax you&#x27;ll see on like mdn! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;color#formal_syntax"

    that can be done with CSS animations.  Unfortunately, it seems so specifically
    tuned to CSS and CSS alone that it&#x27;s hard to learn and conceptualize than
    doing things via JS programmatically.  I just don&#x27;t think in those terms.  I
    have enough trouble with all the options for css flex usage.

    :\n  The :has() pseudo-class cannot be nested within another :has(). This is because\

    This is just lambada calculus and has no tape movement - requires checkin boxes,\

    \ halts, or stops actually checking(computing) the state for a HALT&#x2F;desired\

    seems cool, actually. SASS repeats CSS exhaustively through HTML-encoded steps\
    \ until a valid one is painted - that valid one being the HALT&#x2F;output. You\
    \ do have to specify the number of steps, though. You would have to know whether\
    \ or not it halts, the answer, and how many steps it took to compute to functionally\
    \ (heavy-lifting in this context) use it - or else it would have to reference\
    \ itself....which would make it a higher grammar.<p>But it can&#x27;t:\n<a href=\"\

    \  This can create cyclic dependencies where a custom property uses a var() referring\

    don&#x27;t want to deal with all that mess&quot; can specify what they want to
    see, and the code can change based on their preferences.<p>Unfortunately, I believe
    for &quot;custom jobs&quot; like this you&#x27;d need to explicitly state that
    you don&#x27;t want it to occur because it won&#x27;t happen by default, unlike
    some other stuff that&#x27;s more standard in the browser.

    it&#x27;ll be as much of a security risk as JS.<p>Preferably a blocker that allows

- comment: '@keyframes specifies what the values should be at specific moments in
    a timeline, but not what values they can be between those moments.<p>Certain types
    are continuous between two values which allow them to be smoothly interpolated
    in an animation. For example, an animation from 10px to 20px would be 15px in
    the middle.<p>Certain types are discrete, so they cannot be smoothly interpolated.
    For example: flex to grid. There&#x27;s no half flex half grid value. An animation
    would just hard switch to the other value.<p>Variables can be assigned continuous
    typed values, discrete typed values, or values that can be continuous or discrete.<p>If
    you&#x27;re animating over a value where you don&#x27;t know if the animation
    is continuous or discrete, you have to treat it as discrete to avoid nonsense
    values.<p>This is why @property at-rule exists. It allows you to specify &quot;this
    variable&quot; is of a continuous type, and it can not be overridden by a discrete
    type in the future, which among other things, allows a variable to be animated
    smoothly when it otherwise couldn&#x27;t be without the chance of encountering
    a nonsense value.'

    because clients might send &quot;identical data&quot; as POST multiple times.
    You have to know what they want to do in business logic anyway and clients need
    to understand your response.<p>Sure you can give them &quot;409&quot; or &quot;303&quot;
    back, but who expects those? Which one do you choose? You have to document it
    anyway? Or do you return 400 { error: &quot;Already exists&quot; }?<p>This isn&#x27;t
    well defined in the HTML spec so implementing PATCH feels useless. It&#x27;s easier

    is pretty universally used <i>in English</i>. Most people who use it call the
    Microsoft RDBMS &quot;sequel server&quot; not &quot;ess-cue-ell server&quot; and
    I hear &quot;sequel&quot; slightly more than spelling out the acronym these days.
    The UK does tend to prefer to make a word out of an acronym though, so we tend
    to say things like OS (Operating System) as &quot;oss&quot; not &quot;oh-ess&quot;.
    This led me in a conversation once to only realise at the end that the guy was
    talking about &quot;RTOS&quot; (which I had only ever read, and used the more
    American &quot;AR-TEE-OH-ESS&quot;) when he was saying &quot;are-toss&quot;.<p>Edited

- comment: Anecdotal, but fair, since I can say the opposite. I&#x27;ve largely heard
    it said as S Q L, ro the point when someone verbally calls it &quot;sequel&quot;
    it takes me an extra moment to remember what they are referring to. I rationalize
    it thus; we don&#x27;t make words from our other acronyms that aren&#x27;t already
    pronouncable words to some degree. Exploring that, we don&#x27;t say &quot;fibby&quot;
    when we mean FBI or &quot;see ya&quot; when we mean CIA (maybe we should, though?).
    DARPA, on the other hand, is pronouncable on its own, so we&#x27;ll say the word
    instead of D A R P A. Another one is HIPAA, which is interesting, since its pronouncable,
    but people often get the acronym wrong as HIPPA when writing&#x2F;typing it (FAFSA
    being another good example) although that is more US-centric.<p>Anyway, our treatment
    of saying the word instead of saying the letters of the acronym is interesting
    to think about, I guess. I reckon there&#x27;s a lot of cultural and linguistic
    influence there. Perhaps someone smarter than me can unpack it.

    is a very good overview of the project.<p>One interesting artifact of &quot;the
    real world simulates itself&quot; is version control.  At Dynamicland, each version
    of a program is a sheet of paper (with a unique set of fiducials along the edges).  If
    you want to edit a program, you grab a keyboard and point it at the program.  A
    text editor comes up; you make your changes, and hit commit.  When you do, it
    spits out a new piece of paper with your changes.  Put it in the view of the camera
    to use the new version.  Take it away and use the old paper to roll the change
    back.

    I&#x27;d ask if the source code for the operating system (or &quot;computing environment&quot;,
    in Dynamicland-speak) is available anywhere and also if there yet exists any DIY
    hardware guides for building your own to play with at my own location (far from
    the Oakland&#x2F;Berkeley Dynamicland facility).<p>I believe the FAQ confirms
    that this is not possible at the moment:<p>&gt; Where can I get Realtalk?<p>&gt;&gt;
    At present, Realtalk exists in Dynamicland spaces and in the spaces of our collaborators,
    where we can carefully grow and tend in-person communities of practice. In the
    short term, additional spaces will be started by people who have contributed significantly
    to an existing space and have internalized the culture and its values. Long term,
    we intend to distribute the ideas in the form of kits+games which will guide communities
    through building their own computing environments that they fully understand and
    control. Long long term, computing may be built into all infrastructure as electric
    light is today. This would also require an extensive network of educational support.

    a computing technology. Immediate analogy would be stuff like the &#x27;open space&#x27;
    model adopted from anarchist organising into design thinking. Which unfortunately
    lost its function in the transition. Moving from being a way of generating and
    consolidating multiple perspectives &#x2F; ideas &#x2F; intentions, into a way
    of generating engagement without influence on a projects direction.<p>It doesn&#x27;t
    seem like the effort here is to keep out any group, but rather to maintain a cohesive
    structure to the technical and group work aspects of it. Social technologies can
    be as brittle as they are useful, and abstracting &#x2F; commodifying them can
    often make them work in a way that directly undermines their creators intentions.

- comment: 'I spent quite a lot of time at Dynamicland Oakland. It&#x27;s great fun
    and the people are just wonderful. I think of Realtalk as adding another layer
    to programs, the Physical Layer. Program behavior can be determined and controlled
    by physical layout as well as code. It&#x27;s not completely unlike a frontend&#x2F;backend
    distinction, and in fact you could make a Realtalk simulator using a javascript
    canvas much more easily than building the camera&#x2F;projector setup.<p>Just
    like building full stack software, there&#x27;s a large amount of nonobvious skill
    in dictating your separations of concerns between the physical layer and software
    layer. Good programs are flexible, remixable, modular, intuitive, and let non-programmers
    make nontrivial interactions and enhancements via the physical layer. Bad programs
    require you to have the physical objects in a particular configuration, or break
    completely if one piece of paper is lost. I found these programming design questions
    a really interesting part of playing at Dynamicland.<p>A solid limitation of the
    system is that the pieces of programs aren&#x27;t actually modular. You can&#x27;t
    take a Cat from one program and a Dog from another program and have the dog interact
    with the cat. This is obvious in software - that&#x27;s why we design APIs - but
    it&#x27;s frustrating when all your programs exist in the same space (that&#x27;s
    the whole selling point) and when bringing part of Program A into Program B is
    so intuitive and, when you have dozens of these programs lying around the room,
    inevitable.<p>I&#x27;d love to see them explore (wait for it...) using AI. Incorporating
    object recognition could remove the need for pasting dots onto every object by
    defining rules like &quot;when you see a car, color it Red&quot;. It could allow
    for inter-program interoperability via the shared language of object recognition.
    And it could even determining logical interactions in a fun and surprising way:
    what _should_ happen when I take the cactus from this program and put it on top
    of the balloon from that program?'

    that&#x27;s why we design APIs - but it&#x27;s frustrating when all your programs
    exist in the same space<p>I also thought this, but learned that what I needed
    was an Alan Kay style &quot;change of perspective&quot;.<p>The key for me was
    understanding the &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;claim&quot; concepts in Realtalk.
    In your example above, you would need to separate your &quot;Dog&quot; program
    into two programs: One that was simply a program claiming &quot;I am a dog&quot;
    and another that would encode dog behavior, something like &quot;I wish that a
    bark sound would play when a dog is near a house&quot; - then you&#x27;d leave
    it up to Realtalk to make that happen. Adding &quot;Cat&quot; behavior would mean
    adding two new programs: one to claim &quot;I am a cat&quot; and another &quot;I
    wish that a meow sound would play when a cat is near a house&quot;. To make the
    &quot;Dog&quot; and &quot;Cat&quot; interact, you&#x27;d add a program that said
    &quot;I wish that a growl sound would play when a dog is near a cat&quot; and
    so on.<p>Another example that might help is how I learned this myself: I made
    a set of playing cards. What I ended up with was 52 pieces of card stock, each
    one had a program that was simply &quot;Claim that I am card X&quot; - and then
    I made separate programs the give those cards meaning. For example a program to
    give the cards a style would be something like &quot;I wish that card 1 will have
    the Ace of Spaces printed on it, etc&quot; and another program would be something
    like &quot;I wish that the sum of all face values of the cards on this line is
    printed next to the line&quot;<p>It took me several days to internalize this,
    but once I did things started getting fun pretty quickly. For example, I was able
    to make a program to &quot;clone&quot; a real world image onto a playing card
    by having Realtalk take a picture of a rectangle and then always project that
    image onto a particular card when it was face up. Because the cards just made
    claims about their identities, this let me separate the designs on the cards from
    the rules as well as add &quot;training mode&quot; programs to help teach basics.
    And they were all decoupled!'

- comment: I think the cool part about this is that you can easily build a user interface
    from physical objects, so you can skip some of the digital frontend and design
    and focus more on the computational backend. This frees you up for more explorative,
    improvised coding, which is great for research and art but maybe also many other
    situations where fixed user interfaces get into the way too much. Based on what
    they show about their biology lab project, it seems to be surprisingly useful.

    himself working on human interfaces at Apple in the Steve Jobs iPad era.  In 2012,
    he gave a couple of influential talks: Inventing on Principle, and Stop Drawing
    Dead Fish.<p>Bret&#x27;s take on being a visionary&#x2F;futurist is fascinating.  He
    imagines the near-future world he wants to live in, prototypes enough of it to
    write a talk about, and gives the talk with the hopes that someone in the audience
    will be inspired to make it a reality.  He gives ideas away with the hope that
    he&#x27;ll be paid back with a world where those ideas have been realized.<p><a

- comment: It&#x27;s pretty hard for one person or even one small team to both (a)
    do advanced green-field research in whichever uncertain direction they feel most
    exited to explore, and (b) make a complete and polished saleable product which
    best meets the needs of a well-defined set of customers.<p>The skills, personalities,
    organizing principles, and methods involved are substantially different, and focusing
    on making a product has a tendency to cut off many conceptually valuable lines
    of inquiry based on financial motivations.<p>Notice that Bret Victor&#x27;s goal
    (like most researchers) is not to become as rich as possible.<p>Whether researchers
    or product developers ultimately have more leverage is something of a chicken-and-egg
    question. To make an analogy, it&#x27;s like asking who was more influential,
    Karl Marx or Otto von Bismarck.

    said, I have to admit that it doesn&#x27;t really feel &quot;right&quot; based
    on what I&#x27;ve seen. there&#x27;s so many limitations to the physical world
    that a virtual space doesn&#x27;t have. i get that physical objects can participate
    in the UI and that arranging things in 3D space is sometimes nicer than using
    a mouse&#x2F;keyboard.<p>However, the fact that there is still code written on
    pieces of paper, and that the projector can only show a 2D image (which is only
    primitively interactable) just looks super awkward.  and the question of &quot;what
    can you do&quot; when you&#x27;re staring at a blank table seems tough<p>again,
    it&#x27;s super cool research but i wonder if he has plans to resolve some of

    the UX, but I think putting everything into paper takes it too far.<p>Putting
    things on paper means you cannot share things outside of your immediate community
    which I think is one of the main advantages of computing and the internet.<p>Creating
    a place for physical community is great, making a UX which allows sharing that
    experience is great. Firewalling your ideas off from the rest of the world, not
    so great.<p>I could see a world where these communities are federated. Maybe your
    local computing community is connected to other locales as well as somewhere else
    which is far away (like we do today with sister cities).

    not a problem in a purely virtual version.<p>I do get that it&#x27;s a bit of
    a side step but it&#x27;s also currently completely inaccessible unless you happen
    to be a part of one of the labs it&#x27;s moved to since the other public space
    closed during the COVID shutdowns. Right now there&#x27;s not even a physical
    space one could go to if they could make the trek out, unless I&#x27;m misreading

    physical spaces when we could build and improve the tech at the core of it until
    projectors and cameras get cheaper than the 50-200 USD per sq foot some more open

    would also need some mechanism to connect the modules together. I played around
    with VCV Rack [1], but adjusting knobs with a mouse feels very different than
    using your hands to turn a physical knob. Also, I would like to have more freedom
    in arranging modules more freely as you could do on a table, instead of using

- comment: 'I think the overall idea here is really cool.

    But ... to me the idea of printing stanzas of code onto paper and then putting
    them on a board so they can be OCRed back into text and then re-parsed seems circuitous.
    Like as a demonstration that in principle you <i>can</i> work this way on code
    as well as on more  spatially-native concepts, it seems fine, but is that actually
    the best way for all kinds of work? Or can we acknowledge that this makes more
    sense for some things than for others?'

- comment: It&#x27;s not OCR.  Those colored dots along the periphery are fiducials.  They&#x27;re
    how Realtalk recognizes a program.<p>Every object that you can interact with in
    Realtalk has a unique set of fiducials.  When the camera sees one, it looks up
    its behavior and projects it accordingly.

- comment: Correct, that doesn&#x27;t work in the system as implemented. But my understanding
    is that there has been a goal from the start to _eventually_ get physical code
    editing to work. I recall hearing the researchers talking about wanting to eventually
    get handwriting recognition working, so you could edit code by hand.

    right now. It does still make the code more accessible by making it immediately

    it up.

- comment: '... so in the intro video at like 2:37, it says that a program can be
    in language, or an arrangement of components, or a hand-drawn diagram, because
    anything you can write an interpreter for is a program. The &quot;arrangement
    of components&quot; and the &quot;hand-drawn diagram&quot; shots show stuff drawn
    on a whiteboard, which seems like it can be edited by redrawing. Are you saying
    that a hand-drawn diagram program can be freely edited by changing the diagram,
    but a language-based program cannot be edited by changing the representation of
    its code? That seems ... worse.<p>I would think that you&#x27;d want a fiducial
    marker on code-printouts to identify that a piece of code has a language and a
    namespace perhaps (i.e. &quot;this page contains a kotlin definition that lives
    in com.acme.foo&quot;), but that the contents should be modifiable. Otherwise,
    what&#x27;s the point? If to edit the code you&#x27;re gonna pull up a keyboard
    and screen (or project an editor window) ... then this seems like what we already
    have, plus you have to print stuff out.'

    can change any program at any time and see the changes immediately&quot;, which
    demonstrates live editing the code and seeing the projected flow lines change
    color. So you can keep editing and iterating on the program, trying out your changes
    without ever having to print anything. Once you are satisfied with your improvements,
    you then &quot;commit&quot; the code, which results in the system printing out
    a new page with its new identifier.<p>And if any part of your expectations isn&#x27;t
    how things work, it&#x27;s likely because this is a research project and nobody
    has written the code to make it behave the way you&#x27;d like. Since Realtalk
    is built on itself, one would only need to make the appropriate changes to improve
    the system.

- comment: One of the most striking things about this for me is how clearly it demonstrates
    the fact that community and sharing are not the same thing.<p>Building tools that
    enable communities to share effectively seems like another additional challenge,
    and the fact that virtual spaces and digital spaces are dismissed seems like it
    might prove a major roadblock to connecting and sharing in a larger inclusive
    community.<p>Given the interest in leveraging this for doing science it also seems
    that this is at risk for empowering individual labs while leaving all interfaces
    to the rest of the larger scientific community dependent on the current utterly
    broken system of publication.

- comment: For those criticizing, think of this updated website more from the lens
    of art, less pragmatics. The Doug Engelbart &quot;Mother of All Demos&quot; functioned
    in this way as well. Can you imagine scoffing at Engelbart in the same way? There
    are quite a few deep ideas in this presentation of Dynamicland, many of which
    are subtle and take some effort to find and appreciate, much like art.<p>Yes,
    it is intended to be useful to many one day, and they claim it &quot;actually
    works&quot; _now_, but if you read carefully (and you should!), they are trying
    very hard to maintain (and gradually grow) a beautiful little flame of a vision.
    PARC, on the other hand, had 10 years. Afterwards, industry ran with the ideas
    they wanted, and Alan Kay has been beating the &quot;you missed the big ideas!&quot;
    drum since. The Dynamicland group is trying to learn from this lesson of history.<p>Kudos
    to the group.

    parse&#x2F;compile some of the popular programming languages including C++ and

- comment: I think you can look at some of the other replies in this thread to see
    how deeply this can be misunderstood. And I think the fear is more about losing
    the meaning of dynamicland.<p>The source code isn&#x27;t the idea, the idea is.
    That&#x27;s what needs to be communicated.<p>The web page is huge, though, with
    an unbelievable amount of information if you want to build your own.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dynamicland.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2023&#x2F;Front_shelf"

- comment: I get that impulse because Bret&#x27;s pretty good about communicating
    his whole vision and it definitely has a large amount of philosophy attached to
    it beyond just the tech, but I fear it&#x27;s more likely to smother the technology
    and the idea and ensure it doesn&#x27;t get much adoption. Right now there&#x27;s
    not even a space I could go to to check it out it sounds like because the old
    physical space was shutdown during COVID and the only implementations now are
    in a handful (or one?) lab. Much less if I had a space and was interested in trying
    the exploratory computing ideas for museums and education out before building
    a larger space I&#x27;ve got nothing to work with.<p>Ultimately trying to tightly
    control a technology because he wants it to have a particular impact seems like
    it&#x27;s just going to ensure it stays a niche demo instead of making and impact
    at all. If the idea is strong enough people will adopt and adapt it for themselves
    because it&#x27;s good.

- comment: It would be easier to agree with you if there were no examples of closed
    source software, or even non-software ideas (such as libraries), spreading and
    having huge impact.<p>Bret is also in no rush here, the plan has taken a decade
    so far and has milestones ahead of it for a decade more.

- comment: I read your comment, then I read the page.<p>I disagree on every single
    line.<p>This is not about software. Having the software on its own won&#x27;t
    help you.<p>If in 2006, the year before the iPhone came out, you had the software
    as FOSS, would that help? There was no hardware yet. There was nothing even with
    a capacitative touch screen with multitouch yet. The whole point of the design
    was  to do away with styli, but all extant touchscreen devices needed styli back
    then.<p>I was implementing corporate networks in 1991. I built them with NetBEUI
    for PC-to-PC comms, and IPX&#x2F;SPX or DECnet for talking to servers. Occasionally
    all 3.<p>If I gave 1991 me the source of timbl&#x27;s WorldWideWeb, it would be
    no use. I didn&#x27;t have NeXTstep. My corporate workstation ran X11 and talked
    to servers over it but it didn&#x27;t run TCP&#x2F;IP. I had no TCP&#x2F;IP in
    the building.<p>The point of the Web is the protocol, having clients and servers.
    Having docs is much more use than having code. Code is useless fragile stuff.<p>Android
    reproduces a lot of the interaction model of the iPhone but it came from seeing
    iPhones and trying iPhones. It did not come from getting source. Nobody ever got
    the source.<p>Forget the source. Source code doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s an
    irrelevant distraction.<p>Source code is not the big deal here. Inventing a new
    way to interact with computers is the big deal here.  Getting at the software
    <i>does not matter</i>.

    and the current screen&#x2F;GUI paradigm will decline, but the embodiment will
    be different. The physically embodied computer of the future will be a humanoid
    robot, and we will interact with it the same way we do with humans: by gesturing

    a place for books, but we will have less reason to use them when we can accomplish

- comment: Despite appearances, dynamicland isn&#x27;t about any particular paradigm
    on its own. It&#x27;s a set of values and a way of looking at media that come
    together to create computer-literate communities and even culture.<p>This is obviously
    a bit vague, especially if you look at all the things they&#x27;re doing with
    the cameras and the projectors and the dots and all that. There&#x27;s nothing
    stopping anyone &quot;running&quot; dynamicland on anything else.<p>It&#x27;s
    a completely different way of looking at computers, and it&#x27;s basically saying
    &quot;monitors, keyboards, mice, projectors, smartphones, tablets, laptops, vr
    headsets and xr headsets are all different kinds of ways to experience computation
    in the flesh. We want to explore what happens when we change the fundamental assumptions
    that computing is something you do (alone) in front of &#x27;a computer&#x27;.
    What could computing look like if it was reimagined from the ground up, and we
    used people instead of person as our target audience, space instead of product,
    extensions of existing media rather than inventing new media, literacy instead
    of profession&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to really explain in one go, I&#x27;ve
    been following Bret Victor since before he even started ok CDG<p>Regardless, I
    think it&#x27;s the future for precisely one reason; it&#x27;s easier, cheaper
    and more powerful. People can and people will integrate it with all the high tech
    stuff that we already have, that includes powerful desktops, vr, smartphones etc.

- comment: '<i>&gt; The physically embodied computer of the future will be a humanoid
    robot, and we will interact with it the same way we do with humans: by gesturing
    and speaking.</i><p>I disagree.<p>First of all, there&#x27;s nothing particularly
    &quot;physically embodied&quot; about talking and gesturing at a robot. You can
    do that just as well with a screen showing a virtual robot and a camera with gesture
    recognition. Unless you&#x27;re <i>touching</i> the robot, it doesn&#x27;t have
    a body that&#x27;s meaningfully interactive.<p>Second, for many human endeavors,
    social interaction is not the primary way most people pursue it or want to pursue
    it. Yes, there are definitely some people with, say, an &quot;executive mindset&quot;
    who love social interaction so much that they want that to be all they do all
    day every day.<p>But for many people, the activities they enjoy most are ones
    that involve solitary direct manipulation. If I&#x27;m going fishing, I want to
    cast the lure myself and feel the snap of it thrum through the rod. I want to
    feel the tension on the line when a fish bites. Waving at a robot and asking it
    to catch me a fish would be a strictly, catastrophically inferior experience.<p>What
    is gardening if your hands don&#x27;t get dirty or woodworking if you don&#x27;t
    come home smelling like wood shavings?<p>Here&#x27;s a way to look at it: When
    people retire and no longer need to choose their activities based on financial
    need, how much time to they often end up spending giving instructions to people?
    I hear a lot of retirees puttering in their garden, playing board games, tinkering
    on an old motorcycle, or getting better at guitar. Some definitely do join community
    organizations too, but humans are as much a tool-using species as a social one.'

- comment: Victor&#x27;s previous work has all been huge inspirations to me, but after
    many years of this project that I initially was hyped for there are just some
    big red flags to me that this isn&#x27;t the way forward really or even a good
    use of his talent.<p>Big talk about solving the worlds problems out in the room
    and not on the phone I agree with in sentiment but I feel all that big talk falls
    completely flat on it&#x27;s face when the project you&#x27;re pouring money and
    most importantly time only exists in one space and only benefits a small group
    of academics and then that issue being gushed over as if its a benefit when really
    it just means you&#x27;re not actually building in the real world at all you&#x27;re
    building a fake thing in a fake world for the 0.01% of people to larp with.<p>Think
    the world of computing could greatly benefit from Brett but almost in his success
    it means he&#x27;ll just be able to play pretend in the world of &quot;non-profit&quot;&#x2F;academia
    meaning the output will be citations + grants not value and there will be no real
    benefit to computing from that work.<p>Maybe I&#x27;d feel different if the intro
    video ended with a repo and a list of hardware to build your own Dynamicland,
    I almost think the fact it doesn&#x27;t is a tactic for the project to never have
    to really prove its value...

    user input on a computer (knobs, buttons, textarea, pointers, etc.) - using actually
    3d printed models of houses in a wind simulation is fun, but would you print another
    house for each iteration of the design? what&#x27;s the point here? - and the

    some need to analyze LLMs out of all the things?<p>When you want to understand
    trends of the output of your Agent &#x2F; RAG on scale, without looking manually
    at each trace, you need to another LLM to process the output. For instance, you
    want to understand what is the most common topic discussed with your agent. You
    can prompt another LLM to extract this info, Laminar will host everything, and
    turn this data into metrics.<p>&gt; Why do we need to evaluate LLMs?<p>You right,
    devs who want to evaluate output of the LLM apps, truly care about the quality
    or some other metric. For this kind of cases evals are invaluable. Good example
    would be, AI drive-through agents or AI voice agents for mortgages (use cases
    we&#x27;ve seen on Laminar)

    to our stack<p>* High quality FE which is fully open-source<p>* LLM Pipeline manager,

    Ability to track progression of locally run evals, combining full flexibility
    of running code locally without need to manage data infra<p>* Very generous free

    free tier users without scaling it too much.<p>And many more to come in the coming
    weeks! On of our biggest next priorities is to focus on high quality docs.<p>All
    of these features can be used as standalone products, similar to Supabase. So,
    devs who prefer keep things lightweight might just use our tracing solution and
    be very happy with it.

    them look parallel, see the diagram in [2]. Once you have learned it, it is hard
    to unlearn it, to the point that once in a while my eyes and brain will snap onto
    repetitive patterns like grid paper or just text without any intention to do so.<p>[1]

- comment: I tried this, and while I didn&#x27;t have any difficulty establishing
    a stereoscopic view it didn&#x27;t jump out for me at all. I perceived the blue
    line floating on top of the problem handhold, but the handhold seemed to be on
    the same plane as all the others. Knowing it was the problem one, I could use
    the stereoscopic view to see it, but without already knowing I don&#x27;t think
    it would be apparent.<p>This is odd to me since I&#x27;ve successfully used stereoscopy
    in the past to find small differences. For some reason, with this image, rather
    than causing a change in perceived z-level, my eyes fight for dominance and my
    left ends up winning.

- comment: I don&#x27;t watch this event but, coming from other sports, I think there&#x27;s
    more to this than sheer muscle memory. Humans are not machines. Sometimes you
    compete with ongoing or lingering injuries. Conditioning changes even for the
    most disciplined of athletes. All of these mean that a different approach might
    be warranted for each event depending on your &quot;set-up&quot;.<p>Not to mention
    other variables outside of the human body. Perhaps the type of rope could matter
    in your performance. The age of the holds could matter too; even when the governing
    body standardizes on a replacement period for holds, I&#x27;m sure competitors
    would have strong opinions about the difference between a hold at the start of
    its service life versus one about to be replaced.<p>Also, the one thing I love
    seeing in physical contests is how competitors eke out the last bit of performance
    advantage with sheer willpower. Muscle memory takes care of the actions but performance
    and willpower is a conscious effort.<p>In short, no, I don&#x27;t think competitors
    can literally turn off their conscious brain and just let muscle memory take over.
    If a field has jargon, there&#x27;s a hell lot to geek over it.

    That&#x27;s kind-of the definition of flow.<p>or people who describe an expert
    as someone who is unconsciously competent, they no longer have to think about
    what they are doing they just &quot;know&quot;.<p>And as yallpendantools is saying,
    operating at that level of expertise is much much more than sheer muscle memory,
    though the muscle memory is critical. My typing skill certainly helps me find
    flow in my programming work, I don&#x27;t have to think about how to type each
    letter, when I&#x27;m in flow the ideas &quot;just appear&quot; on the screen.<p>So
    rather than saying the competitors turn off their conscious brain, maybe it is
    better to say that they transcend it?

- comment: And who is the arbiter of which use is correct? Language is always evolving
    and changing, the definitions of words you grew up with were just the definitions
    at that time. The meaning of a word is only defined by how people use and understand
    it.<p>It is possible to use words incorrectly, but if 90% of people use a word
    in a certain way, that becomes the definition.

    it&#x27;s not literal doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong because the information

    continued beyond the materials limits to the thermodynamic limits and private
    entities became exponentially emancipated from states and the old moral panics
    never re-emerged&quot; the content of the book is almost all good but for one
    thing that we now know to have aged horribly. That thing is augmented reality.<p>Every
    augmented reality device more advanced than subdermal hearing aids to have ever
    been built has found only a very small minority of users who actually enjoy the

    in inwardly-facing capitalist computronium predates Accelerando. While I&#x27;m
    unaware of the intermediate steps the idea took to get to Stross it&#x27;s the
    thesis of many of the various essays that Nick Land scattered across Usenet in
    the nineties and probably goes back to Lyotard&#x27;s writings in the eighties
    and earlier.

    Accelerando is a tour de force - the ideas-per-page ratio is just phenomenal,
    and 20 years ago it left me feeling future-shocked. But it&#x27;s pulp, in the
    sense that it&#x27;s very much rooted in the time it was written (the curse of

    Accelerando is a book that anyone can read. Involving hyperintelligent cats and

    for the philosophical aspect (it has a very interesting way of placating transhumanism)
    but also for the entertainment aspect (aforementioned shrimps, did I mention the
    Iranian space program?)<p>Stross is a very approachable author, Accelerando is
    not his most accessible book, but if you can go through half of Diaspora, you
    can easily go through the entirety of Accelerando.

- comment: Like you, I find that sci-fi and its derivatives is where many readers
    often miss the point. It&#x27;s not a overly &quot;happy ending&quot; genre, which
    I think is important to provide balance to all the literary genres as a whole,
    since many of them aren&#x27;t exactly trying to make the reader depressed. That&#x27;s
    not so much the goal of sci-fi authors either, but instead to make the readers  <i>think,</i>
    which, yes can and often does drive is into the darker parts of what society,
    humanity and existence has to offer. It&#x27;s important to have a functional
    place to approach these things, in my opinion, which is why I shy away from the
    utopia&#x2F;optimistic stuff in the genre that rarely seems to gain the popularity
    the more darkly speculative and dystopian stuff does.<p>It&#x27;s not for everyone,
    I guess. But it should be. Your 1984 example is fantastic since we are seeing
    this exact thing play out in US politics today, with a tyrannical group trying
    to usher in a police state and the sycophants that walk lock-step right along
    with it, enamored by the delusion that they are the good guys because their demagogues
    don&#x27;t explicitly say the quiet part out loud.

- comment: General text embeddings aren&#x27;t that great for keyword search. The
    best embedding match for a paragraph is going to be another paragraph with the
    same meaning. &quot;Cats are natural carnivores.&quot; should be very similar
    to &quot;Felines eat meat.&quot;, and somewhat similar to &quot;Tigers eat meat.&quot;<p>&quot;cat&quot;
    is not a sentence - the embedding should be close to other contextless single
    words, and maybe just slightly closer to paragraphs about cats than paragraphs
    about non-cats.<p>A simple way to use embeddings for search is to generate text
    of the same kind you expect your users to input - e.g. if you expect users to
    ask questions in natural language, have a cheap LLM turn paragraphs like &quot;Cats
    are natural carnivores.&quot; into questions like &quot;What do cats eat?&quot;
    &quot;What is natural behaviour for cats?&quot; and then index the embeddings
    for those.

- comment: This could of course be a bug, but it&#x27;s worth noting that vector searching
    in general is a semantic (&quot;meaning based&quot;) search technique, but it
    doesn&#x27;t operate on the actual text, it operates on the resulting embedding
    so it may well make sense to include a (possibly fuzzy) full text search as well
    to catch literal instances of the text if that&#x27;s what you actually need.<p>That
    said, the particular example you give may be either a configuration problem or
    just that &quot;cat&quot; is a particularly bad choice of word to use for a vector
    search in your corpus.<p>HNSW[1] is an approximate nearest neighbour search technique.
    So if you visualise the embedding as distilling your documents down to a set of
    numbers, this vector forms the coordinates of a point in a high-dimensional vector
    space. HNSW is going to take the word &quot;cat&quot; in your example, embed that,
    and find what are probably the closest other vectors (representing documents)
    in that space by your distance metric.[2]<p>Now, it&#x27;s easy to imagine the
    problem - if your document corpus is about something very unrelated to cats (like
    say your corpus is a bunch of programming books), the results of this search are
    going to be basically just random, because you have a big blob of embedded documents
    in your corpus which are relatively close together and your search term embeds
    way off in empty space and therefore the distance from the search term to any
    given document is extremely large.  If you were to search a topic that is reflected
    in your corpus, your search term could embed right in the middle of that blob
    and the distances would be much more meaningful meaning the results are likely
    to be more intuitive and useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1603.09320"

    the original paper that introduced the technique<p>[2] The probably&#x2F;approximately
    get out is what allows the computational complexity of HNSW to stay reasonable
    even if the corpus is large

- comment: Augmenting your search with fuzzy matching is a good idea. You might also
    try embedding with smaller chunk sizes (5-8 sentences) at a time. The paragraph
    breaks will usually not be a problem. The bigger the chunk text, the more likely
    that the attention in llm embeddings can downplay the significance of a word.
    You can also use individual sentences with something like FastText to do very
    rapid embeddings with a smaller vector length and great quality (imho) with higher
    precision. Also much easier to run in production without paying for a GPU server
    or API tokens.

- comment: This seems really neat!<p>DeepMind and AlphaFold are clearly moving in
    a closed-source direction, since they created Isomorphic Labs as a division of
    Alphabet essentially focused on doing this stuff closed source. In theory it seems
    nice for academic tools to have an open source version, although I&#x27;m not
    familiar enough with this field to point to a specific benefit of it.<p>So what&#x27;s
    your plan for the company itself, do you intend to continue working on this open
    source project as part of your business model, or was it more of a one-off? Your
    website seems very nonspecific about what exactly you intend to be selling.

    for the protein design field. No one else was building it fast enough for us,
    so we decided we should do it ourselves. We are committed to training and open-sourcing
    the full version with ligand and nucleic acid prediction capabilities as well

    \ when those forces exactly balance out, and maybe that would be an ideal time\
    \ (or place, if these constants vary by location) to make precise measurements\

- comment: The speed of light will always be seen to be the same no matter what, no
    matter where you are, no matter when you are.  That&#x27;s because we measure
    the speed of light with light, and we measure distances using light or light-by-proxy
    (because the electronic interactions that make normal forces what they are...
    electronic and subject to the speed of light, as is everything else).<p>Other
    constants might change, but it would be very surprising if the speed of light
    (as observed locally) could possibly vary.

- comment: c is no longer measured, it is defined, and unless some contradiction to
    special relativity is discovered, c cannot change. If the speed of causality changes,
    then our measure of distance would change. For example, if c halves in some sense,
    then this means light travels half as far during N ticks of a clock, and the meter
    will halve (and all internet latencies will approx double!). If we keep the old
    meter, then we might say c has changed; it&#x27;s truly a matter of definition
    (and practicality) at that point.

    improbable based on our current understanding of the universe.<p>That there is
    no time before the big bang (possibly with some qualifiers to define the big bang,

    from how I understand things.

    might well have started with the big bang. There would be an absolute zero point
    in time, and nothing could be before that just like nothing can be colder than
    0K.<p>For a while there was also the theory that the universe is cyclical: it
    eventually collapses and from that compressed state a new big bang is born. That
    seems very unlikely with what we know right now though.<p>Then there are various
    forms of the multiverse theory where are kind of spontaneously created in a continuous
    process. Each universe experiences a big bang in the moment it is created, so
    talking about &quot;before the big bang&quot; only makes sense outside the universe<p>But
    I don&#x27;t think anything rules out a universe laying dormant and then something
    triggering the big bang either. Changing fundamental constants might well be that
    something. They don&#x27;t even have to change continuously or frequently for
    this to work<p>As you might have guessed, testing any of these is really difficult.

- comment: Most so called fundamental constants appear in the relationships between
    physical quantities only as a consequence of choosing arbitrary units.<p>It is
    possible to eliminate almost all fundamental constants by choosing so-called natural
    units for the base physical quantities, for instance the elementary charge as
    the unit of electric charge.<p>For all fundamental constants that can be eliminated
    by choosing natural units it makes no sense to discuss about changes of them.<p>Nevertheless,
    even when a natural system of units is used, there remain 2 fundamental constants
    (plus a few other fundamental constants that are used only in certain parts of
    quantum field theory).<p>The 2 important fundamental constants that cannot be
    eliminated are the Newtonian constant of gravitation, which is a measure of the
    intensity of the gravitational interaction, and a second fundamental constant
    that is a measure of the intensity of the electromagnetic interaction, which is
    frequently expressed as the so-called constant of the fine structure.<p>The meaning
    of the constant of the fine structure is that it is the ratio between the speed
    of light in vacuum and the speed of a charged particle with unit charge, like
    an electron, that rotates around another charged particle with unit charge, which
    is much heavier, like a nucleus, in the state with the lowest possible energy,
    i.e. like the ground state of a hydrogen atom, but where the nucleus would have
    infinite mass. The speed of the rotating particle is a measure of the strength
    of the electromagnetic interaction between two elementary charges.<p>So the only
    fundamental constants for which there could be a evolution in time are those that
    characterize the strengths of the electromagnetic interaction and of the gravitational
    interaction (and also the fundamental constants that characterize the strengths
    of the nuclear strong interactions and nuclear weak interactions).<p>The values
    of these fundamental constants that characterize the strengths of the different
    kinds of interactions determine the structure of the Universe, where the quarks
    are bound into nucleons, the nucleons are bound into nuclei, the nuclei are bound
    into atoms, the atoms are bound into molecules, the molecules are bound into solid
    or fluid bodies, which are bound by gravitation into big celestial bodies, then
    into stellar systems, then into galaxies, then into groups of galaxies.<p>Any
    changes in the strengths of the fundamental interactions would lead to dramatic
    changes in the structure of matter, which are not seen even in the distant galaxies.<p>So
    any changes in time of the true fundamental constants are very unlikely, while
    changes in the constants that appear as a consequence of choosing arbitrary units
    are not possible (because such fundamental constants are fixed by conventions,
    e.g. by saying that the speed of light in vacuum is 299,792,458 m&#x2F;s).

    \ 1, it cannot be set in practice.<p>The so-called Planck system of units where\
    \ Newton&#x27;s constant is set to 1 is an interesting mathematical curiosity,\
    \ because in it all the physical quantities become dimensionless.<p>Nevertheless,\
    \ when Newton&#x27;s constant is set to 1, the number of fundamental constants\
    \ is not reduced, but another constant that was 1 in other systems of natural\
    \ units becomes a fundamental constant that must be measured experimentally, for\
    \ instance the elementary charge.<p>Besides not having any advantage, because\
    \ the number of fundamental constants in non-nuclear physics remains 2, the system\
    \ where Newton&#x27;s constant is set to 1 cannot be used in practice.<p>The reason\
    \ is that the experimental measurement of Newton&#x27;s constant has huge uncertainties.\
    \ If its value is forced to be the exact &quot;1&quot;, then those uncertainties\
    \ are transferred to the absolute values of all other physical quantities. In\
    \ such a system of units the only values that would be known precisely would be\
    \ the ratios of two quantities of the same kind, e.g. the ratios of 2 lengths\
    \ or of 2 masses. Any absolute value, such as the value of a length or the value\
    \ of a mass, would be affected by huge uncertainties.<p>So the use of such a system\
    \ of units is completely impossible, even if it is mentioned from time to time\
    \ by naive people who know nothing about metrology. The choice of units for the\
    \ physical quantities cannot be completely arbitrary, only units that ensure very\
    \ low uncertainties for the experimental measurements are eligible.<p>Currently\
    \ and in the foreseeable future, that means that one of the units that are chosen\
    \ must be a frequency. For now that is the frequency corresponding to a transition\
    \ in the spectrum of the cesium atom, which is likely to be changed in a few years\
    \ to a frequency in the visible range or perhaps in the ultraviolet range. In\
    \ a more distant future it might be changed to a frequency in a nuclear spectrum,\
    \ like this frequency that has just been measured for Th229, if it would become\
    \ possible to make better nuclear clocks than the current optical atomic clocks,\
    \ which use either trapped ions or lattices of neutral atoms.<p>Some of the parameters\
    \ of the &quot;standard model&quot; are fundamental constants associated to the\
    \ strong and weak interactions. It is debatable whether it makes sense to call\
    \ as fundamental constants the rest of the parameters, which are specific properties\
    \ of certain objects, i.e. leptons and quarks."

- comment: The masses of the particles and other specific properties, like magnetic
    moments, are not fundamental constants.<p>They are the properties of those particles.
    There are such properties for leptons, for hadrons, for nuclei, for atoms, for
    molecules, for chemical substances, for humans and so on.<p>Any object, either
    as small as an electron or as big as the Sun is characterized by various numeric
    properties, such as mass.<p>The fundamental constants are not specific to any
    particular object. As I have said, after eliminating the fundamental constants
    that are determined by conventional choices of the system of units, the only fundamental
    constants that remain are those that characterize the strength of each fundamental
    interaction, as expressed in a natural system of units.<p>Because most objects
    are composed of smaller subobjects, it should have been possible to compute their
    properties from the properties of their components. Starting from the properties
    of leptons and quarks, it should have been possible to compute the properties
    of hadrons, nuclei, atoms, molecules and so on.<p>Unfortunately we do not have
    any theory that can compute the desired properties with enough precision and in
    most cases even approximate values are impossible to compute. So almost all properties
    of particles, nuclei, atoms or molecules must be measured experimentally.<p>Besides
    the question whether the fundamental constants can change in time, one can put
    a separate question whether the properties of leptons and quarks can vary in time.<p>Some
    of the properties of leptons and quarks are constrained by symmetry rules, but
    there remain a few that could vary, for instance the mass ratio between muon and
    electron. It is likely that a future theory might discover that this mass ratio
    is not an arbitrary parameter, but the muon is a kind of excited state of the
    electron, in which case this mass ratio could be computed as a function of the
    fundamental constants, so the question whether it can vary would be reduced to
    the question about the variation of the fundamental constants.

    constants that can be made dimensionless, so they are not dependent on the choice
    of units. Also, the masses of fundamental particles are connected to the strength
    of the coupling of the particle&#x27;s field to the Higgs field, and those coupling
    strengths are fundamental constants.

- comment: Throwing frozensets out, too. If regular sets aren&#x27;t obscure enough,
    frozensets might be your thing. It looks like a set, it acts like a set, but its...
    hashable (for indexing) and (immutable.) Why use this? For algorithms that rely
    on combinations (not permutations), frozensets can be very useful. E.g. NOT this
    -- (0, 1) (1, 0) (both distinct using tuples) vs frozenset([0, 1]) ([1, 0] or
    [0, 1] have the same identity &#x2F; frozenset.) You can use this for indexing
    algorithms and things like that. Sometimes, sets are very convenient because they
    naturally &#x27;normalise&#x27; entries into a fixed order. This can simply a
    lot of code.

- comment: Did you read the article? This type of phased array has a rather large
    number of moving parts, including a number of folding GHz transmission lines.
    Personally, I&#x27;m very skeptic whether we&#x27;ll ever see this design outside
    of bespoke high performance applications.<p>The fact that this is very cool doesn&#x27;t
    change the huge advantage classic planar phased arrays have by literally having
    zero moving parts.

    a movable array. There are folds, sure, but they seem entirely static. And the
    only time it was even mentioned is when deploying it via satellites (unfolding
    the array into a particular configuration).

- comment: To quote the section &quot;Eggbox Phased Array&quot;:<p>&gt; This unit
    cell, like an origami design, may be folded across either axis or laid flat, allowing
    you to physically change the direction of radiation. Because the phased array
    antenna on each face can steer the beam further, the antenna can be utilized to
    generate almost any radiation pattern using a combination of physical folding
    and electronic beam steering.<p>To me &quot;physically change the direction of
    radiation&quot; is rather explicit that the antenna isn&#x27;t static.

    to point out to others that they don&#x27;t have Groq, which is free for normal
    everyday use and has the fastest inference compared to the options provided by
    Firefox.<p>My extension does a very specific thing and is not supposed to be a
    replacement for a chatbot. There&#x27;s no typing involved, just a short keystroke.<p>I
    have no reviews so far, but in my experience, it has also been &#x27;accurate&#x27;
    in explaining words, sentences, and short paragraphs to me.<p>I believe that,
    for now, my extension will be the most viable option for people who don&#x27;t
    pay for their LLM use and only want certain things explained to them, after which
    they can be left alone to do their work.

    a while (almost two years now!) and it&#x27;s been nothing but excellent!<p>Lenses
    are very useful (Reddit lens is on every second search), and I personally really
    like the AI features they are working on.<p>The new more advanced assistant which
    is able to do searches, which can also be constrained to lenses, and lets you
    pick an arbitrary model, is excellent, and basically means I don&#x27;t need a
    chatgpt&#x2F;claude subscription, as Kagi covers it very well.<p>All in all, great
    product which I&#x27;m happy to pay for.

- comment: I really wanted to like Kagi, I&#x27;m onboard with paying for search,
    but I&#x27;ve had had a big issue with its speed when doing the trial to be honest,
    am I the only one bothered by this?<p>Perhaps this is because I&#x27;m in Europe
    and it&#x27;s faster in the US? A search request to Kagi seems to take around
    two seconds for me (shows as ~1s in the Kagi UI), it just feels really unpleasant
    compared to Google, I&#x27;m used to firing of a couple searches with different
    wording &#x2F; terms and go through results quickly, feels like I&#x27;m being
    held back.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled, but if I&#x27;m paying for search I would
    really like it to be at least on par with Google, the search result quality seems
    ok from what I can tell, lenses don&#x27;t really make sense to me, they seem
    to filter out too many results I would have liked to actually see, but the customization
    like adjusting the rating of individual websites is fantastic.<p>If they can manage
    to bring the speed to match that of Google, I&#x27;d be happy to pay for it I
    think.

- comment: Thanks.  I have a couple of thoughts to share:<p>Back in the day, IBM did
    a usability study.  An application requiring the user to specify operations and
    fields for data input was setup two ways:<p>One way was manual, lots of clicks,
    and or input sequences. Each one did a specific thing quickly.<p>The other way
    was highly automated and the user was only required to click a few times.  The
    tasks were the same.  This way had more flow, fewer discrete commands, more functionality
    woven together.<p>To their surprise the users felt they were more productive with
    the software they clicked more, despite the automated version being less work
    and the workflow more efficient.<p>I bet the effective reduction in your search
    is minor, but the delays do accumulate and demand attention.<p>Given that, a small
    change to your flow may well change things!<p>What you should do is rapidly input
    your first queries and then as they appear, drill down on those, and when that
    appears, start to eliminate dead query windows, or drop fresh queries into them.<p>What
    you prefer, to use a car analogy, is one that corners like no other.  Then you
    find yourself in one that lacks corner cases.<p>So you maximize your time in lane,
    straight road, batching the corner driving and flooring it on the straights.<p>I
    used to experience a similar thing running a browser on IRIX vd NT.  The NT browser
    was quicker to respond where the IRIX one would delay a little and then just render
    it all quick<p>I just started working with a few windows.  Changed everything.  I
    would be typing in new queries while one I waited for was about to render.<p>It
    was a change from rapid fire to a more batch mode.  Soon, I rarely had to think
    and my flow was fast all around.<p>I put this shared experience here in the hope
    you may be inclined to try different things.

    I would understand the complaints about slowness if searches were taking like
    ten seconds, but a few seconds, I really must be getting old.<p>I still remember
    when google was giving relevant results in page 2. Now it&#x27;s pretty much useless
    for me, and the fast search makes me think they are throwing away tons of potentially
    good stuff just to make it fast (and place more ads and rubbish scam&#x2F;ai sites).

    realize), and agree that the experience and search results have been excellent.  I
    don&#x27;t use lenses, but make heavy use of bangs, and I like that I can up-
    and down-weight domains and even ban domains outright.<p>But I don&#x27;t really
    care about AI assistants.  If these AI integrations will improve the bog-standard
    search experience (I type something in the search bar, get a list of results,
    and click the one I think will give me what I want), that&#x27;s great.  But if
    not, this is just noise to me.

    experience of using Kagi was great but not &quot;$10 per month&quot; great compared
    to free alternatives. On top of that I got the feeling that Kagi is not a super
    &quot;professional&quot; company; for example by spending huge amounts of money
    on self-printing useless t-shirts (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;celebrating-20k"
    rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;celebrating-20k</a>) or haphazardly
    suddenly charging tax on subscriptions.<p>What I want most of all from a search
    engine is to be &quot;internet plumbing&quot; and mainly stay out of my way, and
    with Kagi I always had the feeling they would suddenly remove&#x2F;change&#x2F;add
    things because of some strong opinion their founder holds. In which case I don&#x27;t
    want to be $108 committed for a year.

- comment: 'It uses Google&#x27;s index, among others.<p>Being able to personalize
    your own search is truly the killer feature, though, in a couple of ways.<p>The
    first is as you point out: being able to &quot;edit your own algorithm&quot; is
    really nice.  I don&#x27;t have to try to &quot;train&quot; Google&#x27;s algorithm
    to show the results I want, and it&#x27;s very easy to say &quot;I never want
    to see this site in my results again&quot;.  I&#x27;m still shocked Google doesn&#x27;t
    have that feature even as some kind of client-side Javascript.<p>The second is
    Lenses.  It&#x27;s so obvious in hindsight that a singular algorithm is insufficient
    for search.  Nobody wants or needs their searches for porn to impact their searches
    for technical documentation, or vice versa.  There are more nuanced examples,
    but that&#x27;s the most obvious (also, I don&#x27;t think Kagi indexes NSFW content

- comment: I&#x27;m a paying Kagi user. I don&#x27;t think that I can give a clear
    example or explanation of why they are better, partly because it&#x27;s been a
    long time since I used DDG, and I gave up pretty quickly. The one thing I can
    say is that, for the short time I was using DDG, I found myself doing a search,
    and then in most cases, immediately redoing the search using the !g, because the
    DDG results were bad, and even though I am also dissatisfied with google results
    these days, they were better. Kagi has the same functionality, but I find myself
    almost never using it.<p>That being said, if you personally are happy with your
    DDG results, then I&#x27;d say you should probably stick with it. Kagi _might_
    be better for you than DDG, but if you aren&#x27;t actively dissatisfied (the
    way I was with Google and everything else), then the room for improvement is smaller.
    Might be worth using their free tier (which is 100 queries per month I think)
    just to test out some side by side searches though.

    that were errantly removed by Bing. Since Bing is their upstream results provider,
    I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting away from the overreach of big tech, so
    I went to Kagi where they don&#x27;t solely rely on upstream providers as they
    have their own crawler and such. The fact that they offer other great features
    like filtering results, and integrated AI makes it worth switching and paying
    for. Plus, I hate ads. Targeted or not. So I&#x27;m willing to pay to make that
    go away for a quality service.

- comment: I tried using DDG many times in the past. I found myself using the !g constantly,
    because I wasn&#x27;t finding what I needed in the DDG results. After a while,
    I started preemptively adding !g, because I assumed DDG would fail me, as it often
    did.<p>With Kagi, I haven&#x27;t had that. It finds what I need and surfaces things
    that Google didn&#x27;t. On the one or two occasions I&#x27;ve had trouble and
    jumped to Google out of desperation, I also didn&#x27;t find what I was looking
    for there... so I guess an answer didn&#x27;t exist.<p>For sites I don&#x27;t
    like, I can block them from my results, or rank things higher&#x2F;lower. I can
    make my own custom !bangs and shortcuts, instead of being stuck with what I&#x27;m
    given. While I haven&#x27;t used Google since they launched their AI features,
    I can say I have really enjoyed Kagi&#x27;s AI responses to questions, and that
    each line of the response is referenced so I can check out the source (not sure
    if they all do this or not... I can only compare it to ChatGPT, which does not).

    that it often fails with. DDG will fail to find the nuance in my search query,

    while - this being the most evolved version of that effort. I am not totally sold
    on everything they are doing but I hate their integration of LLMs the least.

- comment: Kagi&#x27;s auto summary feature when you add a question mark after your
    query is absolutely excellent.<p>It essentially summarizes the top search results
    for you, leaning in on a strength of LLMs (summarizing) while reducing its greatest
    weakness (hallucinations).

    all commercially available models. Including open-source models. There are no
    rate limits.<p>You pay a different rate per model (OpenRouter shows the pricing
    transparently). You load your account with credits. I use it daily (undoubtedly
    far more than the average user) and loaded 50$ with credits five months ago, but
    I still have over 1&#x2F;2 of it left.<p>I think it is hard to believe that Kagi
    would be any cheaper and have no rate limits.

- comment: Keep in mind that, while OpenRouter gives you the upstream price for OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic
    models (so you pay the same per token), there&#x27;s a loading charge, so if you
    want to load $10 in credits you pay $12 or so.<p>This means that it&#x27;s more
    expensive than calling OpenAI directly, even though they have the same price per
    token.

- comment: Where the loading charge is amortized over all the calls made.<p>If you
    want to use precisely one API, paying directly for that API is cheaper. However,
    that&#x27;s only true with closed-source providers. Anyone can host a server running
    llama 3.1 that OpenRouter could (in theory) use, bringing price competition to
    model cost. Closed-source models have a monopoly and can set their price wherever
    they want.<p>I&#x27;m okay with spending an extra 2$ every six months to access
    the APIs of any model I want.

    answer for example is phenomenal IMHO.  Most of the time I am searching is because
    I need information for something.  The &quot;quick answer&quot; and it&#x27;s
    source citing can much more quickly tell me whether the results are worth a click.  At
    this point I would hate to return to the old list of links output.

- comment: I think the problem is we&#x27;re blending two different methodologies
    for finding information. When I search for something I want to get to the source.
    Others just want the answer. Ideally it should still be smart enough to figure
    that out, kinda what it does already if you search with a question.

    I turn to LLMs. I don&#x27;t want to read half the docs on an AWS product, I want
    the snippet of code that I care about. Kagi, as best as I can tell, is the only
    search service which can answer these questions and also respects me as a customer.<p>I
    think of it this way: there&#x27;s often not a single page (or even small handful
    of pages) that answer a query. The LLM features answer the question with text
    that links to the pages, rather than answering my question with pages that might
    contain pieces of answers.'

    I&#x27;m subscribed to both services and tried the Ultimate tier for a few days
    two weeks ago to test the new assistants. If they add the ability to search with
    multiple steps and allow the AI to digest more results, then they could be on
    par. It&#x27;s more similar to ChatGPT at this stage, IMO.

- comment: I honestly think FastGPT is the best implementation of AI w&#x2F;search,
    and is extremely versatile&#x2F;useful across domains (granted I don&#x27;t code).
    I think it&#x27;s the same thing as the Quick Answer feature from their standard
    search.<p>In my daily work as an MD it&#x27;s become my reflexive go-to for looking
    up answers to specific to general, easy to complex clinical questions. I use it
    far more frequently than UpToDate (which is no less than the holy book of medicine),
    more than PubMed&#x2F;Google Scholar searches, and definitely more than a basic
    web search (Google, only b&#x2F;c it&#x27;s a hassle to log in to Kagi every session
    at work).<p>Maybe 1 time out of 10 it won&#x27;t give a correct or meaningful
    answer (in which case my prompt needs to be refined, or is just not suited for
    this kind of tool). But apart from that it will give me exactly what I need, because
    it uses Kagi search to source its answers. Kagi search does a decent job bringing
    to the top relevant journal articles (which in turn may mention other articles,
    adding indirectly to the trove of sources FastGPT pulls its final answer from).
    It shows the 5 search results it referenced at the bottom of the page, so more
    often than not if I don&#x27;t get my answer in the direct summary, I have very
    relevant sources to read through.<p>I also don&#x27;t think you need a Kagi account
    to use it.

    \ search, I find the value of the assistant no longer worth it. At first, I thought\
    \ I would be able to replace other providers with the wide range of offered models,\
    \ but now I find myself often going to distinct providers. Kagi seems to have\
    \ introduced a harsh and generalized input token limit for prompts (detached from\
    \ what the underlying model can handle), which makes it almost impossible to work\
    \ with code or documents. I think the VW example in the announcement makes it\

    searching by sentences instead of keywords. I don&#x27;t see input for documents\
    \ or things like code execution coming here, so the difference of $15 monthly\
    \ can get me fancier features.<p>Mixing the output of the model with the limited\
    \ content of approximately five websites (= Assistant with internet access), on\
    \ average, is most of the time counterproductive for me. The sites mentioned in\
    \ the sources of the output are often not sites I would usually visit or get information\

    \ I have used search engines for decades now and have built a sort of index&#x2F;pattern&#x2F;feeling\
    \ in my head for which site I am going to visit, which AI can not match for me.<p>The\

- comment: Avoiding the ads doesn&#x27;t fix the alignment issues. Even without ads,
    modern google search is dramatically worse than a decade ago, and I&#x27;m personally
    pretty confident it&#x27;s because their interests and user interests are not
    well aligned. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with Kagi.

- comment: Customizing your search results is a big part of it. When I tried Kagi,
    I did not find it to be a huge improvement on Google until I started adjusting
    the rankings of my search results. Now I find it painful to go back to Google
    when I use someone else&#x27;s computer or device.<p>The other big part of it
    (for me at least) is seeing more obscure websites in my results. I have had Kagi
    for a year now, and it has saved me more money than I&#x27;ve spent on it by making
    it easier to find specific products at lesser-known shops. These lesser-known
    shops often have really great sales because they are trying to compete against
    the big names, and Google pretty much <i>only</i> shows me the big names.

    should get better and more personalised over time.<p>(I hope it&#x27;s ok to share
    something I&#x27;ve built along a similar vein here.)<p>I wanted to get long-term
    memory with Claude, and as different tools excel at different use cases, I wanted
    to share this memory across the different tools.<p>So I created MemoryPlugin (<a
    href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.memoryplugin.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.memoryplugin.com</a>).
    It&#x27;s a very simple tool that provides your AI tools with a list of memories,
    and instructs them on how to add new memories. It&#x27;s available as a Chrome
    extension that works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and LibreChat, a Custom GPT
    for ChatGPT on mobile, and a plugin for TypingMind. Think of it as the ChatGPT
    memory feature, but for all your AI tools, and your memories aren&#x27;t locked
    into any one tool but shared across all of them.<p>This is meant for end-users
    instead of developers looking to add long-term memory to their own apps.

    that I&#x27;ve heard a few times now: will you support the open source version
    as a first class citizen for the long term? A lot of open source projects with
    a paid version follow a similar strategy. They use the open source repo to get
    traction, but then the open source version gets neglected and users are eventually
    pushed to the paid version. How committed are you to supporting the open source
    version long term?'

    that many of us have had with present large language models. It seems to me that
    the addition of a stateful memory layer potentially allows for LLMs that are not
    only more intelligent but also more efficient and user-friendly, because they
    can be tailored to individual users. And your design for an open-source, hybrid
    memory system also seems like a big step forward for the developer community both
    for the inventiveness of the system itself and for the potential it has for serving
    as a model for whatever comes next after LLMs.

- comment: 'Congrats Taranjeet and Deshraj!<p>So after using Mem0 a bit for a hackathon
    project, I have sort of two thoughts: 1. Memory is extremely useful and almost
    a requirement when it comes to building next level agents and Mem0 is probably
    the best designed&#x2F;easiest way to get there.

    2. I think the interface between structured and unstructured memory still needs
    some thinking.<p>What I mean by that is when I look at the memory feature of OpenAI
    it&#x27;s obviously completely unstructured, free form text, and that makes sense
    when it&#x27;s a general use product.<p>At the same time, when I&#x27;m thinking
    about more vertical specific use cases up until now, there are very specific things
    generally that we want to remember about our customers (for example, for advertising,
    age range, location, etc.) However, as the use of LLMs in chatbots increases,
    we may want to also remember less structured details.<p>So the killer app here
    would be something that can remember and synthesize both structured and unstructured
    information about the user in a way that&#x27;s natural for a developer.<p>I think
    the graph integration is a step in this direction but still more on the unstructured
    side for now. Look forward to seeing how it develops.'

- comment: 'Thanks for your question!<p>Vector databases are typically used for storing
    embeddings and are great for tasks like similarity search. However, they are generally
    read-only and don&#x27;t natively support the concept of time or state transitions.
    Let&#x27;s take an example of tracking state of a tasks from your todo list in
    a vector database:<p>You might store the task&#x27;s states like:<p>Task 1 in
    backlog

    Task 1 in progress

    Task 1 in canceled<p>But there&#x27;s no concept of &quot;latest state&quot; or
    memory of how the task evolved over time. You&#x27;d have to store multiple versions
    and manually track changes.<p>With a memory-enabled system like Mem0, you could
    track: Task 1 (current state: in progress) with a memory of previous states (backlog,
    canceled, etc). This gives your AI app more stateful understanding of the world,
    allowing it to update and reflect the current context automatically.<p>Traditional
    databases, on the other hand, are designed for structured, relational data with
    fixed schemas, like customer information in a table. These are great for handling
    transactional data but aren&#x27;t optimal for cases where the data is unstructured.<p>As
    mentioned in the post, we use a hybrid datastore approach that handles these cases
    effectively and that&#x27;s where the graph aspect comes into picture.'

- comment: 'Thanks for your question!<p>Claude Prompt Caching and Mem0&#x27;s memory
    system have several key differences:<p>1. Purpose and duration: Claude&#x27;s
    cache is designed for short-term memory, clearing every 5 minutes. In contrast,
    Mem0 is built for long-term information storage, retaining data indefinitely unless
    instructed otherwise.

    2. Flexibility and control: Mem0 offers more flexibility, allowing developers
    to update, delete, or modify stored information as needed. Claude&#x27;s cache
    is more static - new information creates additional entries rather than updating
    existing ones.

    3. Content management: Claude has minimum length requirements for caching (1024
    characters for Sonnet, 2048 for Haiku). Mem0 can handle information of any length,
    from short facts to longer contexts.

    4. Customization: Developers have greater control over Mem0&#x27;s memory management,
    including options for prioritizing or deprioritizing information based on relevance
    or time. Claude&#x27;s caching system offers less direct control.

    5. Information retrieval: Mem0 is designed for more precise and targeted information
    retrieval, while Claude&#x27;s cache works with broader contextual blocks.<p>These
    differences reflect the distinct purposes of each system. Claude&#x27;s cache
    aims to maintain recent context in ongoing conversations, while Mem0 is built
    to serve as a flexible, long-term knowledge base for AI applications.'

- comment: "Thanks for the question. Here&#x27;s how Mem0 differs from ChatGPT memory:<p>1.\
    \ LLM Compatibility: Mem0 works with various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic,\
    \ Groq, etc.), while ChatGPT memory is tied to OpenAI&#x27;s models only.<p>2.\
    \ Target Audience: Mem0 is built for developers creating AI applications, whereas\
    \ ChatGPT memory is for ChatGPT users.<p>3. Quality and Performance: Our evaluations\
    \ show Mem0 outperforms ChatGPT memory in several areas:<p><pre><code>    - Consistency:\
    \ Mem0 updates memories more reliably across multiple instances.\n\n    - Reliability:\
    \ ChatGPT memory can be inconsistent with the same prompts, while Mem0 aims for\
    \ more consistent performance.\n\n    - Speed: Mem0 typically creates memories\
    \ in about 2 seconds, compared to ChatGPT&#x27;s 30-40 seconds to reflect new\
    \ memories.\n</code></pre>\n4. Flexibility: Mem0 offers more customization options\
    \ for developers, allowing better integration into various AI applications.<p>These\
    \ differences make Mem0 a better choice for developers building AI apps that need\
    \ efficient memory capabilities."

- comment: 'I made the first version of this back in 2010, when Pearl&#x27;s work
    on causal inference started impacting Epidemiology. A friend was an Epidemiologist
    and she told me about an MS-DOS program she was using to do something with graphs
    (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20010223&#x2F;);" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20010223&#x2F;);</a>
    she found it painfully slow and wondered if I could &quot;make it more user-friendly&quot;.<p>I
    did my PhD in algorithms at the time and was intrigued when I started reading
    Greenland, Pearl, and Robins (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;9888278&#x2F;"
    rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;9888278&#x2F;</a>)
    and then Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Causality&quot;. I soon found that it was not obvious
    at all how you could speed up that MS-DOS program, and it led to a paper at UAI
    in 2011 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1202.3764" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1202.3764</a>).
    I made dagitty as a demonstration that you could actually use the algorithms we
    developed in that paper, and it took off from there -- started with 10 users per
    day, growing to the hundreds and thousands as causal inference became more popular.<p>It&#x27;s
    now a bit dated, and I don&#x27;t have as much time anymore to keep it &quot;fresh&quot;
    as I would like. But I am still grateful and amazed at about how many people I
    got to know due to this. Highlights included collaborating with Pearl himself
    on a solution manual for his book &quot;Causal Inference: A Primer&quot; when
    it first came out, and so many e-mails I got out of the blue from users all over
    the world. Just last summer I stayed at the house of the author of one of the
    builtin examples in dagitty.<p>As these 14 years flew by, I now am happy to do
    play a small part in supporting the next generation of causal inference software
    -- if you&#x27;re interested in causal inference, be sure to check out pgmpy.org,
    a Python library for Bayesian networks that includes several causal inference
    functions (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2304.08639" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2304.08639</a>).
    Ankur, the author, did his PhD with me and will soon defend his thesis!<p>Also,
    R users, be sure to check out ggdag, a great package by Malcolm Barrett that wraps
    dagitty functionality in a much nicer and tidyverse-compatible way.'

    back in 2013. To the instructor&#x27;s credit, we spent the first few weeks thinking
    about causal models before we got into any actual stats. (Put differently, a DAG
    is a nonparametric structural equation model [0], and the rest of the stats class
    was about different ways to parametrize those models.)<p>[0] Pearl 2021: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;pub&#x2F;stat_ser&#x2F;r370.pdf"

    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lmnr.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lmnr.ai</a>), an open-source\
    \ observability and analytics platform for complex LLM apps. It\u2019s designed\
    \ to be fast, reliable, and scalable. The stack is RabbitMQ for message queues,\
    \ Postgres for storage, Clickhouse for analytics, Qdrant for semantic search -\
    \ all powered by Rust.<p>How is Laminar different from the swarm of other \u201C\
    LLM observability\u201D platforms?<p>On the observability part, we\u2019re focused\
    \ on handling full execution traces, not just LLM calls. We built a Rust ingestor\
    \ for OpenTelemetry (Otel) spans with GenAI semantic conventions. As LLM apps\
    \ get more complex (think Agents with hundreds of LLM and function calls, or complex\
    \ RAG pipelines), full tracing is critical. With Otel spans, we can: 1. Cover\
    \ the entire execution trace. 2. Keep the platform future-proof 3. Leverage an\
    \ amazing OpenLLMetry (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;openllmetry\"\
    >https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;traceloop&#x2F;openllmetry</a>), open-source\
    \ package for span production.<p>The key difference is that we tie text analytics\
    \ directly to execution traces. Rich text data makes LLM traces unique, so we\
    \ let you track \u201Csemantic metrics\u201D (like what your AI agent is actually\
    \ saying) and connect those metrics to where they happen in the trace. If you\
    \ want to know if your AI drive-through agent made an upsell, you can design an\
    \ LLM extraction pipeline in our builder (more on it later), host it on Laminar,\
    \ and handle everything from event requests to output logging. Processing requests\
    \ simply come as events in the Otel span.<p>We think it\u2019s a win to separate\
    \ core app logic from LLM event processing. Most devs don\u2019t want to manage\
    \ background queues for LLM analytics processing but still want insights into\
    \ how their Agents or RAGs are working.<p>Our Pipeline Builder uses graph UI where\
    \ nodes are LLM and util functions, and edges showing data flow. We built a custom\
    \ task execution engine with support of parallel branch executions, cycles and\
    \ branches (it\u2019s overkill for simple pipelines, but it\u2019s extremely cool\
    \ and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time designing a robust engine). You can also\
    \ call pipelines directly as API endpoints. We found them to be extremely useful\
    \ for iterating on and separating LLM logic. Laminar also traces pipeline directly,\
    \ which removes the overhead of sending large outputs over the network.<p>One\
    \ thing missing from all LLM observability platforms right now is an adequate\
    \ search over traces. We\u2019re attacking this problem by indexing each span\
    \ in a vector DB and performing hybrid search at query time. This feature is still\
    \ in beta, but we think it\u2019s gonna be crucial part of our platform going\
    \ forward.<p>We also support evaluations. We loved the \u201Crun everything locally,\
    \ send results to a server\u201D approach from Braintrust and Weights &amp; Biases,\
    \ so we did that too: a simple SDK and nice dashboards to track everything. Evals\
    \ are still early, but we\u2019re pushing hard on them.<p>Our goal is to make\
    \ Laminar the Supabase for LLMOps - the go-to open-source comprehensive platform\
    \ for all things LLMs &#x2F; GenAI. In it\u2019s current shape, Laminar is just\
    \ few weeks old and developing rapidly, we\u2019d love any feedback or for you\
    \ to give Laminar a try in your LLM projects!"

- description: "Hi HN - we\u2019re the founders of Ligo Biosciences and are excited\
    \ to share an open-source implementation of AlphaFold3, the frontier model for\
    \ protein structure prediction.<p>Google DeepMind and their new startup Isomorphic\
    \ Labs, are expanding into drug discovery. They developed AlphaFold3 as their\
    \ model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from big pharma. They already\
    \ signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3 billion - Google\u2019s becoming a pharma\
    \ company! (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isomorphiclabs.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.isomorphiclabs.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;isomorphic-labs-kick...</a>)<p>AlphaFold3\
    \ is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can do three main things:\
    \ (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2) Predict the structure of drug-protein\
    \ interactions; (3) Predict nucleic acid - protein complex structure.<p>AlphaFold3\
    \ is incredibly important for science because it vastly accelerates the mapping\
    \ of protein structures. It takes one PhD student their entire PhD to do one structure.\
    \ With AlphaFold3, you get a prediction in minutes on par with experimental accuracy.<p>There\u2019\
    s just one problem: when DeepMind published AlphaFold3 in May (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07487-w\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-024-07487-w</a>),\
    \ there was no code. This \nbrought up questions about reproducibility (<a href=\"\
    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-024-01463-0\" rel=\"\
    nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-024-01463-0</a>)\
    \ as well as complaints from the scientific community (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion-alphafold-3-open-source&#x2F;\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undark.org&#x2F;2024&#x2F;06&#x2F;06&#x2F;opinion-alphafold-3-open-sourc...</a>).<p>AlphaFold3\
    \ is a fundamental advance in structure modeling technology that the entire biotech\
    \ industry deserves to be able to reap the benefits from. Its applications are\
    \ vast, including:<p>- CRISPR gene editing technologies, where scientists can\
    \ see exactly how the DNA interacts with the scissor Cas protein;<p>- Cancer research\
    \ - predicting how a potential drug binds to the cancer target. One of the highlights\
    \ in DeepMind\u2019s paper is the prediction of a clinical KRAS inhibitor in complex\
    \ with its target.<p>- Antibody &#x2F; nanobody to target predictions. AlphaFold3\
    \ improves accuracy on this class of molecules 2 fold compared to the next best\
    \ tool.<p>Unfortunately, no companies can use it since it is under a non-commercial\
    \ license!<p>Today we are releasing the full model trained on single chain proteins\
    \ (capability 1 above), with the other two capabilities to be trained and released\
    \ soon. We also include the training code. Weights will be released once training\
    \ and benchmarking is complete. We wanted this to be truly open source so we used\
    \ the Apache 2.0 license.<p>Deepmind published the full structure of the model,\
    \ along with each components\u2019 pseudocode in their paper. We translated this\
    \ fully into PyTorch, which required more reverse engineering than we thought!<p>When\
    \ building the initial version, we discovered multiple issues in DeepMind\u2019\
    s paper that would interfere with the training - we think the deep learning community\
    \ might find these especially interesting. (Diffusion folks, we would love feedback\
    \ on this!) These include:<p>- MSE loss scaling differs from Karras et al. (2022).\
    \ The weighting provided in the paper does not downweigh the loss at high noise\
    \ levels.<p>- Omission of residual layers in the paper - we add these back and\
    \ see benefits in gradient flow and convergence. Anyone have any idea why Deepmind\
    \ may have omitted the residual connections in the DiT blocks?<p>- The MSA module,\
    \ in its current form, has dead layers. The last pair weighted averaging and transition\
    \ layers cannot contribute to the pair representation, hence no grads. We swap\
    \ the order to the one in the ExtraMsaStack in AlphaFold2. An alternative solution\
    \ would be to use weight sharing, but whether this is done is ambiguous in the\
    \ paper.<p>More about those issues here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ligo-Biosciences&#x2F;AlphaFold3\"\
    >https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Ligo-Biosciences&#x2F;AlphaFold3</a><p>How\
    \ this came about: we are building Ligo (YC S24), where we are using ideas from\
    \ AlphaFold3 for enzyme design. We thought open sourcing it was a nice side quest\
    \ to benefit the community.<p>For those on Twitter, there was a good thread a\
    \ few days ago that has more information: \n<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ArdaGoreci&#x2F;status&#x2F;1830744265007480934\"\

    \ any highlighted text to Groq and provides a simple explanation for it.<p>Every\
    \ day, while learning or researching, I often need to look up the meanings of\
    \ words or struggle to understand certain sentences. This breaks my flow and adds\
    \ cognitive load due to context switching. So I created this extension to make\
    \ my life a little easier.<p>It requires your own Groq API key and uses the llama3-70b\
    \ model. All data is stored locally, ensuring your API key remains secure.<p>How\
    \ It Works:\n- Highlight text you want explained and press the shortcut Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd+Shift+E.\n\
    - The extension sends the text to Groq&#x27;s chat completion API\n- Groq&#x27;s\
    \ llama3-70b model generates a simple explanation\n- The explanation is streamed\
    \ within the extension popup automatically<p>Code: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bhavyagada&#x2F;watdat\"\

    \ I&#x27;m broke. I also haven&#x27;t worked on a Safari version for the same\

    \ href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mem0.ai\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mem0.ai</a>). Mem0 adds\
    \ a stateful memory layer to AI applications, allowing them to remember user interactions,\
    \ preferences, and context over time. This enables AI apps to deliver increasingly\
    \ personalized and intelligent experiences that evolve with every interaction.\
    \ There\u2019s a demo video at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VtRuBCTZL1o\"\
    \ rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;VtRuBCTZL1o</a> and a playground\
    \ to try out at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mem0.ai&#x2F;playground\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mem0.ai&#x2F;playground</a>.\
    \ You&#x27;ll need to sign up to use the playground \u2013 this helps ensure responses\
    \ are more tailored to you by associating interactions with an individual profile.<p>Current\
    \ LLMs are stateless\u2014they forget everything between sessions. This limitation\
    \ leads to repetitive interactions, a lack of personalization, and increased computational\
    \ costs because developers must repeatedly include extensive context in every\
    \ prompt.<p>When we were building Embedchain (an open-source RAG framework with\
    \ over 2M downloads), users constantly shared their frustration with LLMs\u2019\
    \ inability to remember anything between sessions. They had to repeatedly input\
    \ the same context, which was costly and inefficient. We realized that for AI\
    \ to deliver more useful and intelligent responses, it needed memory. That\u2019\
    s when we started building Mem0.<p>Mem0 employs a hybrid datastore architecture\
    \ that combines graph, vector, and key-value stores to store and manage memories\
    \ effectively. Here is how it works:<p>Adding memories: When you use mem0 with\
    \ your AI App, it can take in any messages or interactions and automatically detects\
    \ the important parts to remember.<p>Organizing information: Mem0 sorts this information\
    \ into different categories: - Facts and structured data go into a key-value store\
    \ for quick access. - Connections between things (like people, places, or objects)\
    \ are saved in a graph store that understands relationships between different\
    \ entities. - The overall meaning and context of conversations are stored in a\
    \ vector store that allows for finding similar memories later.<p>Retrieving memories:\
    \ When given an input query, Mem0 searches for and retrieves related stored information\
    \ by leveraging a combination of graph traversal techniques, vector similarity\
    \ and key-value lookups. It prioritizes the most important, relevant, and recent\
    \ information, making sure the AI always has the right context, no matter how\
    \ much memory is stored.<p>Unlike traditional AI applications that operate without\
    \ memory, Mem0 introduces a continuously learning memory layer. This reduces the\
    \ need to repeatedly include long blocks of context in every prompt, which lowers\
    \ computational costs and speeds up response times. As Mem0 learns and retains\
    \ information over time, AI applications become more adaptive and provide more\
    \ relevant responses without relying on large context windows in each interaction.<p>We\u2019\
    ve open-sourced the core technology that powers Mem0\u2014specifically the memory\
    \ management functionality in the vector and graph databases, as well as the stateful\
    \ memory layer\u2014under the Apache 2.0 license. This includes the ability to\
    \ add, organize, and retrieve memories within your AI applications.<p>However,\
    \ certain features that are optimized for production use, such as low latency\
    \ inference, and the scalable graph and vector datastore for real-time memory\
    \ updates, are part of our paid platform. These advanced capabilities are not\
    \ part of the open-source package but are available for those who need to scale\
    \ memory management in production environments.<p>We\u2019ve made both our open-source\
    \ version and platform available for HN users. You can check out our GitHub repo\
    \ (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mem0ai&#x2F;mem0\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mem0ai&#x2F;mem0</a>)\
    \ or explore the platform directly at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mem0.ai&#x2F;playground\"\
    >https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mem0.ai&#x2F;playground</a>.<p>We\u2019d love to hear what\
    \ you think! Please feel free to dive into the playground, check out the code,\
    \ and share any thoughts or suggestions with us. Your feedback will help shape\
    \ where we take Mem0 from here!"
