- comment: The second point here made me realize that it&#x27;d be super useful for
    a grep tool to have a &quot;super case insensitive&quot; mode which expands a
    search for, say, &quot;FooBar|first_name&quot; to something like &#x2F;foo[-_]?bar|first[-_]?name&#x2F;i,
    so that any camel&#x2F;snake&#x2F;pascal&#x2F;kebab&#x2F;etc case will match.
    In fact, I struggle to come up with situations where that <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i>
    be a great default.

    decision.<p><pre><code>  ... the language has been designed to be easy to analyze

    Taken from  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;doc&#x2F;faq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.dev&#x2F;doc&#x2F;faq</a><p>The
    &quot;top-level declarations&quot; in source files are exactly: package, import,
    const, var, type, func. Nothing else. If you&#x27;re searching for a function,
    it&#x27;s always going to start with &quot;func&quot;, even if it&#x27;s an anonymous
    function. Searching for methods implemented by a struct similarly only needs one
    to know the &quot;func&quot; keyword and the name of the struct.<p>Coming from
    a background of mostly Clojure, Common Lisp, and TypeScript, the &quot;greppability&quot;
    of Go code is by far the best I have seen.<p>Of course, in any language, Go included,
    it&#x27;s always better to rely on static analysis tools (like the IDE or LSP
    server) to find references, definitions, etc. But when searching code of some
    open source library, I always resort to ripgrep rather than setting up a development
    environment, unless I found something that I want to patch (which in case I set
    up the devlopment environment and rely on LSP instead of grep to discover definitions
    and references).'

- comment: The way I have seen this is that single letter variables are mostly used
    when declaration and (all) usages are very close together.<p>If I see a loop with
    i or k, v then I can be fairly confident that those are an Index or a Key Value
    pair. Also I probably don&#x27;t need to grep them since everything interacting
    with these variables is probably already on my screen.<p>Everything that has a
    wider scope or which would be unclear with a single letter is named with a more
    descriptive name.<p>Of course this is highly dependent on the people you work
    with, but this is the way it works on projects I have worked on.

- comment: C is so much worse than that. Many people declare symbols using macros
    for various reasons, so you end up with things like DEFINE_FUNCTION(foo) {. In
    order to get a complete list of symbols you need to preprocess it, this requires
    knowing what the compiler flags are. Nobody really knows what their compiler flags
    are because they are hidden between multiple levels of indirection and a variety
    of build systems.

    of just not using OOP in the first place.<p>2. Devs trying to stick functional
    programming everywhere because they had seen a trivial example where a `.map()`
    made more semantic sense than a for&#x2F;for-in&#x2F;for-of loop. Despite the
    fact that for&#x2F;for-in&#x2F;for-of loops were easier to read for anything non-trivial
    and also had better performance because you had access to the `break`, `continue`
    and `return` keywords.

- comment: Grep is also useful when IDE indexing isn&#x27;t feasible for the entire
    project. At past employers I worked in monorepos where the sheer size of the index
    caused multiple seconds of delay in intellisense and UI stuttering; our devex
    team&#x27;s preferred approach was to better integrate our IDE experience with
    the build system such that only symbols in scope of the module you were working
    on would be loaded. This was usually fine, and it works especially well for product
    teams, but it&#x27;s a headache when you&#x27;re doing cross-cutting work (e.g.
    for infrastructure projects&#x2F;overhauls).<p>We also had a livegrep instance
    that we could use to grep any corporate repo, regardless of where it was hosted.
    That was extremely useful for investigating failures in build scripts that spanned
    multiple repositories (e.g. building a Go sidecar that relies on a service config
    in the Java monorepo).

- comment: IDEs are cool and all, but there is no way I&#x27;m gonna let VSCode index
    my 80GB yocto tmp directory. Ctags can crunch the whole thing in a few minutes,
    and so can grep.<p>Plus there are cases where grep is really what you need, for
    example after updating a particular command line tool whose output changed, I
    was able to find all scripts which grepped the output of the tool in a way that
    was broken.

    by doing all the hand-holding for you.<p>If your feelings are anemic when tasked
    with doing a grep, its because you have lost a very valuable skill by delegating
    it to a computer.  There are some things the IDE is never going to be able to
    find - lest it becomes the development environment - so keeping your grep fu sharpened
    is wise beyond the decades.<p>(Disclaimer: 40 years of software development, and

- comment: '&gt; <i>All of that is trivial to search for with a tool that understands
    the language.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t string search, or grepping for patterns, even more
    trivial? So what is your argument? You found an alternative method, good, but
    how is it any better?<p>In my own case, I wrote a library that we used in many
    projects, and I often wanted to know where and how functions from my lib were
    used in those projects. For example, to be able to tell how much of an effort
    it would be for the users to refactor when I changed something. However, your
    method of choice at least with my IDE (Webstorm) only worked locally within the
    project. Only string search would let me reliably and easily search all projects.<p>I
    actually experimented creating a &quot;meta&quot; project of all projects, but
    while it worked that lead to too many problems, and the main method to find anything
    still was string search (CTRL-SHIFT-F Find dialog in IDEA IDEs is string search
    and it&#x27;s a wonderful dialog in that IDE family). I also had to open that
    meta project. Instead, I created a gitignored folder with symlinks to the sources
    of all the other projects and created a search scope for that folder, in which
    the search dialog let me string-search all projects&#x27; sources at once right
    from within the library project and still being able to use the excellent Find
    dialog.<p>In addition, I found that sometimes the IDE would not find a usage even
    within the project. I only noticed because I used both methods, and string search
    showed me one or two places more than the method that relied on the underlying
    code-parsing. Unfortunately IDEs have bugs, and the method you suggests relies
    on much more work of the IDE in parsing and indexing compared to the much more
    mundane string or string pattern search.'

- comment: I am firmly against the suggested changes. I love grepping through code
    too (often using -A -B -C), but I also like browsing the code, with tools where
    you can just click on a function and see its definition.<p>However, changing how
    the code should be written so that grepping becomes easier is optimizing for the
    wrong target. It is much more important that the code is easily readable and maintainable.<p>In
    addition, some tools are designed explicitly for grepping through code (from the
    top of my head ack is an example). If grep doesn&#x27;t work, one should try a
    more sophisticated tool instead of using different coding styles.

    the same strings is the best way to show they&#x27;re related, compared to an
    actual map from address type to table name. There might be a lot of things called
    &#x27;shipping&#x27; in my app, only some of which are coupled to `shipping_addresses`.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t
    a linter be able to catch that there is no enum member called MyEnum.ATRISTS,

- comment: '&gt; The input string and output are coupled. If you add string conditionals
    as the author did, you introduce the chance of a mismatch between the input and
    output.<p>I think it depends on whether the repetition is accidental or intrinsic.
    Does the table name <i>happen</i> to contain the address type as a prefix, or
    does it intrinsically have to? Greppability aside, when things are incidentally
    related, it&#x27;s often better to repeat yourself to not give the wrong impression
    that they&#x27;re intrinsically related. Conversely, if they <i>are</i> intrinsically
    related (i.e. it&#x27;s an invariant of the system that the table name starts
    with the address type as a prefix) then it&#x27;s better for the code to align
    with that.'

    on.  Similar, but not to that extent, with typescript. But when coding in Javascript,
    Ruby or Python, no matter how fancy or language-focused an IDE is, I&#x27;ll be
    grepping a lot. Decades of Ruby and Rails &quot;black magic&quot; taught me to
    grep for partial patterns like the author shows, too. Or to just run the code-path
    entirely (through tests) because the table-definition of the database will change
    the available methods and behaviour of the code. Yes. I know.<p>An LSP (or linter,

    Tools that show Callee&#x2F;Caller trees, and sometimes possible data-flows between

    tag-name for the leaf you&#x27;re interested in. (e.g. `&lt;Product&gt;&lt;Name&gt;`
    vs `&lt;ProductName&gt;`)<p>When things go well, the actual variable name no longer
    needs to restate certain aspects and relationships that can instead be found through
    metadata.<p>For example, `GiftCard.purchaser_customer_uuid` is nicely greppable,
    but you could relax that to `GiftCard.purchaser` if it had a static type of `UUID&lt;Customer&gt;`.
    Or perhaps you could go to the `Customer.uuid` definition and say &quot;Show me

    of code search that is much more syntax-aware than just text search, but it tends
    to be behind very limited UI, because we have all the tech to do much better code
    search, but no one has come up with a generally-usable UI for it, so we just have
    very specific instances -- like &quot;go to definition&quot;, &quot;find references&quot;
    , etc.<p>That takes all the same technological bits that would be need for, say,
    &quot;find all definitions of functions visible in the current scope whose name
    starts with &#x27;ban&#x27;&quot; or &quot;find all definitions of int8 constants
    visible in the current scope&quot;...but what&#x27;s the UI that makes that kind
    of searching outside of the kind of special cases now behind their own IDE menu
    items usable?'

    Use a tool that actual understands references. Don&#x27;t make the code harder

- comment: Me too.<p>But that&#x27;s also what makes me uncomfortable when reading
    this article. <i>Proper Naming</i> is truly an &quot;art&quot; of balancing trade-offs.<p>It
    takes domain expertise (Ubiquitous language), understanding of the users of the
    code (other devs, not end-users), and a lifetime of coding f*ups where naming
    something wrong turned out painful to balance these.<p>The author gives a nice
    example of a dynamic table naming. But their refactoring didn&#x27;t keep the
    behaviour the same (the else&#x2F;catch). So it&#x27;s hard to argue the first
    is better. And in this case, even without the else&#x2F;catch, I&#x27;d say the
    latter is better. But there will be cases where greppability is to balanced with
    readability, testability or refactorability. And in these cases, for me, greppability
    comes last.

    to sacrifice good JSON and make it flat just so someone can search for it more
    easily.  With the example they give, it is still readable because it is a simple
    data structure. But with more complex data their flat structure to me does not
    make it easy to parse and easier to make mistakes as well.

    ;) I never really had the inclination to grep for data like the author does.<p>I
    generally work from an IDE anyway, where it is clear that I am working with a
    value that is part of a JSON object and I can follow it back to the proper structure
    anyway.   In fact, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the article
    is written for a very specific use case and perspective. Almost to the point where
    the saying &quot;<i>if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail</i>&quot;
    is applicable. Where if it doesn&#x27;t look enough like a nail it should be adjusted
    to look more like one instead of expanding your toolbox a bit.

    you should be able to ctrl-f and find it in your codebase. 1:1 mapping of data
    -&gt; function.<p>People take a long time to figure out that the readability gains
    from having greppability is worth whatever verbosity that comes, largely because
    they think of code too much as a craft (make it as small&#x2F;neat as possible)
    and not documentation for a live process...

- comment: This is a great point. One of my pet peeves is seeing an error in the logs
    which I cannot find in the code for various reasons. Sometimes the error message
    is constructed in a complicated way with variables concatenated together or the
    error message is extremely generic and I get matches in 100 different places.<p>I&#x27;m
    an advocate for the idea that any aspect of a system which communicates either
    with end users or with sysadmins should be given high exposure in the code base.
    Typically, this means constructing abstractions in such a way that higher-level
    business logic and log messages are easily traceable from a single file. I make
    it so that the business layer sits above all other layers, as close to the program&#x27;s
    entry point as possible.

- comment: 'Grep is indeed a critical tool for navigating and understanding an unfamiliar
    codebase, but greppability should not be a goal unto itself. The article seems
    to be making that mistake - it&#x27;s basically advocating improving greppability
    at the cost of making the codebase even larger, messier, and harder to read: i.e.
    reinforcing the problem that makes you reach for grep in the first place. It&#x27;s
    a false economy. It&#x27;s asking you to optimize your code for one specific scenario
    - trying to figure out where an unfamiliar string comes from; but that isn&#x27;t
    the most important or most frequent thing people need to do with code anyway.<p>(If
    it is for you, congratulations, you&#x27;re the janitor in the codebase. It sucks,
    but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re being paid for. Maintenance is a means, not an
    end.)<p>In particular, one of the most important and frequent thing you do with
    code is <i>read it</i> in order to understand it (locally, at the abstraction
    level of interest), and the advice from this article compromise it badly - almost
    as if hoping that, on a greppable enough codebase, you could use grep to <i>avoid
    reading or thinking entirely</i>.<p>1. Don&#x27;t split up identifiers<p>Don&#x27;t
    split them up for the sake of splitting, sure. That&#x27;s not helping anything.
    But in the example given, there&#x27;s likely a good reason for it - for example,
    it codifies the intended coupling between tables. `billing_address` isn&#x27;t
    an independent term in this code, nor are the other `_address` table names. There&#x27;s
    a naming pattern there, encoded directly in the initial example. The proposed
    refactor obscures it <i>and</i> triples the amount of code in the process (all
    of which is low-value noise) <i>and</i> introduces possibility of making errors
    (typos, copy-paste) of the kind that isn&#x27;t picked up by compilers (hope you
    have good tests!).<p>FWIW, the author&#x27;s refactor <i>may</i> be eventually
    required - if and when the naming pattern in the original code no longer holds.
    But not before then.<p>2. Use the same names for things across the stack<p>Excessive
    data repackaging is bad, but that tends to be a symptom of having too many layers.
    A good layer has specific semantics that distinguish it from layers above and
    below it. This may necessitate renaming some thing, in which case even if such
    renaming is as trivial as in the example, it should be spelled out explicitly;
    you can&#x27;t just return Layer 1 Address object instead of Layer 3 Address object,
    if the two layers mean something different by &quot;Address&quot;; the triviality
    of the mapping is incidental and may not hold over time. If it really feels trivial,
    chances are one of the layers is not necessary in the first place, so go fix that.<p>3.
    Flat is better than nested<p>Now that&#x27;s just screwing with people, especially
    wrt. nesting namespaces. It&#x27;s asking to reintroduce the visual noise that
    the person reading the code will then have to filter out again mentally.<p>The
    way I see it, if you grep for some log message or unrolled identifier and can&#x27;t
    find it, you&#x27;re supposed to <i>keep grepping for parts of the string</i>,
    until you hit a match. You then go look, and it&#x27;s usually apparent that you&#x27;re
    dealing with a compound identifier or an interpolated string - congratulations,
    you just learned something important about that part of the legacy codebase, <i>which
    is the real job you&#x27;re supposed to be doing</i>.'

    color perception. In particular, sRGB displays have a pretty severely limited
    green gamut. If you have a wide-gamut display, the test is probably gonna appear
    different.<p>But another problem is with displaying the colors essentially full-window,
    which is going to be nearly-full-screen for many users. When we&#x27;re staring
    at a screen with a particular tint, our eyes quickly do &quot;auto white balance&quot;
    that skews the results. It&#x27;s the mechanism behind a bunch of optical illusions.<p>To
    address that last problem, I think the color display area should be much smaller,
    or you should be shown all hues at once and asked to position a cut-off point.

    it is green and half the time blue.

    nominally halfway between blue and green, most people&#x27;s thresholds, averaged
    over monitor calibrations, imply that cyan is classified as blue.<p>Perceptually
    (that is, in CIE-LCh color space, for example), the hue component of #00ffff is
    a lot cloer to #00ff00 than it is to #0000ff. But the website doesn&#x27;t ask
    which color is closer, it asks if it&#x27;s &quot;green&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;.
    And how we use those words has more to do with culture than with perception. We
    also call the color of a clear afternoon sky &quot;blue&quot;, even though that
    is perceptually extremely far away from #0000ff.'

    ambient light would affect the screen shows (it&#x27;s emissive, not reflective)
    but because the brain <i>also does</i> &quot;auto white&#x2F;colour balance&quot;.<p>For
    a fun experiment, get your hand on some heavily yellow-tinted party glasses, go
    outside on a clear day with a bright blue sky.<p>When you put them on everything
    will be stark yellow tinged (and the blue sky will be completely off, like green
    or pink, can&#x27;t recall which) but after a little while going on your business,
    perception adjusts and only a much less dramatic yellowish veil is in effect.
    You&#x27;d look at the sky and see almost-blue.<p>The kicker is when you remove
    the glasses: the sky will suddenly be of a glorious pink! (or green, can&#x27;t
    recall) Only moments later it&#x27;ll adjust back to be blue.<p>A certain wavelength
    may be absolute blue of a certain kind, but the perceptual system is all relative:
    &quot;wait, I know this sky should be blue because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve
    always seen, so let&#x27;s compensate&quot;.<p>The same kind of effect - although
    less dramatic - can be achieved with lights that can be adjusted from say 2400K
    to 6500K and having as reference an object that is known &quot;pure white&quot;,
    like a A4&#x2F;letter sheet of paper.<p>This effect, in turn, adjusts how &quot;absolutely
    displayed&quot; colours are identified by way of biasing the whole perceptive
    system. AIUI that&#x27;s the rationale behind Apple&#x27;s True Tone thingy, aiming
    to compensate for that.<p>So the result of this test should be somewhat different
    depending on ambient lighting temperature.'

    in the discussion here is because you&#x27;re asking question (1) (which has three

    that are more blue or more green than each other; they can&#x27;t all be zero.
    Whichever one you choose to be the true transition point between blue and green,
    there will be teals that are more blue or green than that one.

    is flawed when it could be better. When you ask the question &quot;is my blue
    your blue?&quot;, you are evoking the old philosophical question, and it&#x27;s
    a question about color perception, not words. This test did not test color perception,
    it tested &quot;what word do you use?&quot;<p>I think of blue as a pure color,
    and green as a wide range of colors all the way to yellow, to me another pure
    color. so if there&#x27;s any green at all in it, I&#x27;m going to call it green.
    (maybe it&#x27;s left over from kindergarten blending &quot;primary colors&quot;.
    also, while I like green grass, I don&#x27;t like green as a color, so any green
    I see is a likely to make me think, ew, green) But in terms of what I see, I can
    only assume I&#x27;m seeing the same thing as everybody else is because the test
    is not testing it. Just because I call something green doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t
    see all the blue in it.<p>&gt;<i>Edit: Possible improvements: changing the wording
    to &quot;this is MORE green&quot; and &quot;this is MORE blue&quot; and randomizing
    the order in which they are shown, somehow. I realize you&#x27;re just doing some
    kind of binary search, narrowing the color range.</i><p>yes, the test should show
    you pure blue, then a turquoise mix, then pure green, and a ... etc. It should
    also retest you on things you already answered to measure where you are consistent.'

    to call it blue or green, it would not only not be reflecting what I think, but
    I could not guarantee that if I&#x27;m show the exact same color again, that I
    will go the same way. So I felt there was no point in continuing.<p>This is a
    problem in the method; there needs to be a third choice, so that the user can
    always answer (at least if the test color is always in the blue-green gamut).<p>It
    could work with two choices if the user were instructed to randomly choose in
    the event of indecision. I mean, truly randomly, like by means of a fair coin
    toss. But that could just be implemented for them by a third button. That button
    could then just record their indecision rather than randomly choose between blue
    and green, so you have better data.<p>Without a third choice, or properly randomized
    behavior, you have bias problems. For instance, a certain user who likes the blue
    color might always say blue when not able to decide. Another one might always
    go for green. Yet, those two users might exactly coincide in what they unmistakably
    call blue, green and what triggers hesitation&#x2F;indecision.<p>(I realize that
    no matter how many bins we have, there are boundary indecisions, like not being
    able to decide between  green and blue-green. What range constitutes indecision
    is also subjective.)

    colour less than shade. Colour signals, even when I can tell them apart, are just
    less important to me than to non-colourblind people.<p>I most recently noticed
    this playing Valheim with my wife. There are red mushrooms in the game, surrounded
    by green foliage. I noticed that I have trouble spotting them, even though I have
    no problem seeing that they are red and the foliage is green. To her, the mushrooms
    stand out as being very visually different from the background and immediately
    noticeable. To me, they just aren&#x27;t that distinct and get quite hard to spot.<p>So
    while I got the green&#x2F;blue distinction to within 80% of the population, despite
    my shitty colour perception, it just didn&#x27;t matter. At some point in the
    process I got to &quot;I really don&#x27;t care. I would ignore the signal that
    any further difference in colour is sending&quot;.<p>As you can guess, I have
    fascinating talks with designers and artists, to whom the differences really matter.
    I understand that colour is really important to them. I just don&#x27;t see it.

    are red means actively <i>looking</i> at each individual status and thinking &quot;what

- comment: It&#x27;s very cultural. For example, Japan used the same word for green
    and blue, so their green light on traffic lights is as blue as possible while
    conforming to international standards for the light to be &quot;green&quot;.<p>Also,
    there is a pretty well done video by Vox on how color names are influenced by
    culture <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg</a>

- comment: I think this might be a bit overblown. &quot;why do we call it <i>blue</i>
    signal?&quot; is a common 3-5 years old question in Japan.<p>Old Japanese traffic
    signals had blue tinted lenses, like ultramarine blue. Those lenses were used
    in conjunction with warm yellow incandescent lamps, technology available at the
    time. Deep blue + warm yellow = green.<p>Over time the green color must have normalized,
    without laws and slogans not reflecting that. And nowadays they&#x27;re green
    LEDs.

- comment: The blue-green distinction is something that tends to come late in most
    or maybe all language families. Ancient Greek also used the same word for blue
    and green. As I recall, the first color words a language gains are black and white,
    followed by red. Blue-green is one of the last distinctions made.

    three runs, since my first result seemed surprisingly high.<p>It&#x27;s funny
    though - I feel like I&#x27;m less likely to go green on the other direction too.
    I&#x27;d probably say a tennis ball is right on the line, and seems more yellow
    than green to me too.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m some sort of green gatekeeper, and I don&#x27;t
    want to dilute my personal definition with lesser greens. Green is my favorite
    color, I&#x27;d say, so maybe that&#x27;s something to do with it.

    I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called turquoise. The same thing happens with
    the purple spectrum. There&#x27;s an unlimited amount of purple hues, ranging
    from red purple to blue purple. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s pink.

    green or blue, and then on top of that my eyes bias towards green&#x2F;blue. Or
    are you asking for the results of my own test here which show my particular bias
    of turquoise (as the author refers to or cyan as you refer to)? Took the test
    a couple types and varies but for me say I see turquoise as green (though close
    to 50%, so if took a few more times imagine may land blue sometimes and&#x2F;or
    depend on if I&#x27;m viewing in a dark room or light room.

- comment: Sorry not sure I understand. Yes, with each color that appears the I (or
    any user) has to pick which color they see more of, blue or green. Since every
    color shown unless presumably exactly 50% between green and blue, will either
    be more blue or more green. So you&#x2F;I&#x2F;users have to pick if they see
    more green or blue. The person next to you might see a hint of blue and you may
    see a hint of green for the same color since our eyes all work differently. UPDATE-Oh
    you may have been asking that of the person I was replying to initially.

- comment: Yes, that&#x27;s the point of the test, to see how you perceive the ambiguous
    ones. That is, at the end it shows the chart with the left 50% is green and right
    50% is blue. The turquoise in the middle is what is hard to tell if green (aka
    on the left 50% or blue aka on the right 50%). For many the result line isn&#x27;t
    down the middle but more to the left or right, and thus shows if you see turquoise
    (the ambiguous colors) more as blue or green. The text at the bottom of the test
    should put the answer in words&#x2F;numbers.

- comment: Since cyan means 50% green and 50% blue, other than exactly in the middle
    of the chart, all the colors shown are either to the left of cyan(the middle),
    or to the right. So all the colors are either slightly to a lot blue or slightly
    to a lot green. This test is testing where everyone middle essentially is. If
    there were as cyan&#x2F;turqouise option, that would be a very different test,
    I imagine essentially testing to lines, where the line between blue and cyan&#x2F;ambiguity
    begins and the line between green and cyan&#x2F;ambiguity begins requiring I imagine
    several more questions to get that answer and would only then be showing two lines
    on the graph, vs this test which is able to say if you lean more to the right
    or left of the middle of blue to green.

    (something like) it from sea snails was lost long ago (long before it was &#x27;created
    in the lab&#x27; by Perkin in 1850s, igniting the German aniline industry). And
    the old faded art works (back when it was high fashion) are not so reliable either.<p>The
    Wiki sez [0] that in 1998 the process was thought to have been discovered (who
    can be sure?) &quot;True Tyrian purple, like most high-chroma pigments, cannot
    be accurately rendered on a standard RGB computer monitor&quot; and shows 2 quite

    <i>In early experiments, we found that people&#x27;s responses cluster around
    175, which coincidentally is the same as the named HTML color turquoise. This
    is interesting, because the nominal boundary between blue and green is at 180,
    the named HTML color cyan. That means most people&#x27;s boundaries are shifted
    toward saying that cyan is blue.</i><p>That last sentence surprises me. At least
    in French, cyan is also considered a shade of blue. For turquoise I can understand
    that people would call turquoise green, but isn&#x27;t cyan blue for everyone?

    is blue (well yeah, it always has been!).  People often tell me things are green
    that clearly are not, so I&#x27;m wondering what this means.  Does the &quot;165,

- comment: There&#x27;s a few &#x27;kinds&#x27; of red-green colorblind as I understand
    it.  It has to do with whether you&#x27;re missing a type of cone, or whether
    the frequency response of a cone type is shifted.  I knew someone who had never
    experienced what others call &quot;green&quot; - all things supposed to be green
    are brown.  I on the other hand see some green things, but a lot of things other
    people call green are brown, maroon or even purple.  Pastels are the worst.

    varies on an individual basis even for color-normal people. Worse, the transfer
    function of the eyeball also varies with age as your lens yellows and internal
    fluid clouds a bit. Even holding those constant, brains do a lot of processing
    that maps what your eyes can physically capture into perceived colors, which are
    significantly influenced by upbringing.<p>Plus, screens and ambient lighting.
    It&#x27;s a lot of variables.

    And while for most the more initial more obvious blue or greens are easier, when
    close to the middle of in between blue and green (aka turquoise), that&#x27;s
    where it can get confusing, and this test helps to show if your perception leans
    more towards blue or green and by how much.

- comment: '&gt; Becase when I see a mix of blue and green and there is only two buttons,

    If you choose green, because you see a slight more tint of green than blue, yes,
    that&#x27;s what you should do for this particular test. Just as you should choose
    blue if you see slightly more blue. For many when close to the middle hard to
    tell since have to go with your eyes and gut. But if anytime you are unsure if
    blue or green, if you always choose green regardless, then the test presumably
    wouldn&#x27;t provide accurate results.

    &gt; Or maybe I should treat the buttons as &quot;&gt; 0.5 green&quot; and &quot;&gt;
    0.5 blue&quot;.

    Yes, with each color they show, it&#x27;s asking you if you see green (aka more
    green than blue) or blue (aka more blue than green). With the test starting off
    easier and then shades much closer to the middle (either left or right of the
    middle) where much harder to tell without a color picker, and everyone&#x27;s
    eyes will be different and close to the middle you will probably see most as either
    blue or green.'

    Can you help me make a website called is my blue your blue? I want to make a website
    that is in vue.js that allows one to determine the boundary between their perception
    of blue vs. green. It should use a golden ratio search to find the midpoint between
    blue and green. It should have the color be the color of the background, and it
    should have two buttons, blue and green. If they pick green, you should show something
    bluer, and vice versa.

    ```<p>It offered a starter with vue and tailwind, then I asked to add a supabase
    backend. I took maybe 5 hours to get the original version, which I tweaked until
    I got about 800 initial responses so I could show a population curve. Later I
    modded it with cursor to add an about section, fit a proper GLM rather than a
    simple golden ratio estimation method, and the d3 animation at the end.'

    excessive reduction on edge cases. For the purpose of this test though, hues should
    be probably preserved at any cost.<p>While lower saturation may solve this problem,
    some colors do greatly depend on saturation to be correctly perceived, like brown,
    so I don&#x27;t think it is not ideal to change that either.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;css-color-4&#x2F;#css-gamut-mapping"

- comment: A few notes because there are a few  pieces of information which aren&#x27;t
    a 100% up to date:<p>As most people know, Intel have lost the plot and are behind
    AMD on everything CPU and GPU related (with the tiny exception of the N100 series
    CPUs from Intel which are perfect for low power and even fanless applications).
    As such, their CPUs are mostly bought by organisations updating previous environments
    with like for like replacements for whatever reason (like vSphere&#x27;s EVC which
    allows you to run newer processors from the same manufacturer as if they were
    an older model, and enable hot migration between CPU architectures and thus minimum
    disruption on hardware refreshes). Pretty much everyone else is getting the better
    and cheaper (per processing power) AMD CPUs.<p>Intel NICs are pretty good overall
    (the X710 which spent a year+ with broken drivers causing silent network failures&#x2F;downright
    crashes while still being in the hardware compatibility list of VMware and other
    &quot;enterprise&quot; vendors notwithstanding), and they&#x27;re getting more
    popular for consumer devices too. An Intel CPU on a non-low cost PC&#x2F;laptop
    almost always means an Intel NIC (WiFi and&#x2F;or Ethernet).<p>For many organisations
    buying servers, Supermicro* is probably their best option. They&#x27;re cheaper,
    have much higher flexibility in terms of form factors, chassis, components, number
    of whatever slots and mostly reliable. However their support is less reliable
    than the theoretical Dell&#x2F;HPE support, so it works best for redundant setups.<p>Also,
    the IPMI specification is being replaced by Redfish which is much more complete,
    secure, normalised and presents normal usable APIs. Any mainline server from a
    few years ago should have Redfish alongside IPMI.<p>* There&#x27;s recent research
    from Hindenburg, a short selling research firm, that exposes some shady stuff
    from Supermicro - but their hardware is still top notch and used by the hyperscalers.

    * No support for 4 <i>and</i> 3 pins fans. 3 pins are 100% speed all the time.

    * IPMI web interface straight out of 2010.

    * NVME placement prevents you from using heatsinks.

    SSH port just on that instead of the primary NIC, so that the PC has a sorta dedicated
    IPMI interface.<p>Newer versions of the device software come with WireGuard and
    Tailscale support, so I can just connect to it over VPN.<p>Still have some minor
    issues, but the developers are working fast to fix them.

- comment: I really like IPMI, but what I don&#x27;t like about it for homelab use
    cases is the additional ~5W of idle power consumption. Using the Gigabyte MC12-LE0
    Board with Ryzen Pro 5650 for a home server should be a no brainer costing ~50
    bucks, but the higher power consumption is something I&#x27;m not totally happy
    with.<p>On older devices (like Dell T20&#x2F;T30) there is Intel AMT which is
    way less powerful and has security flaws, but at least SOME way to do remote administration
    when used with MeshCommander (unfortunately discontinued and releases deleted
    from everywhere - but I luckily saved the MSI and Node-Package on my server).<p>I&#x27;m
    planning to try out PiKVM (V2) with a Raspberry 4 and a simple 8 bucks USB-HDMI-Capture-Card

    Besides the lack of some features, it looks promising and more universal for devices
    that do not support remote management in any form.

- comment: Perhaps the text itself is functioning as working memory.<p>Both ADHD people
    and neurotypicals have deeply structured thoughts. &quot;Serializing&quot; those
    thoughts without planning ahead leads to the &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;
    writing style, which includes things like run-on sentences and deeply nested parentheses.
    This style is considered poor form, because it is hard to follow. To serialize
    and communicate thoughts in a way that avoids this style, it is necessary to plan
    ahead and rely on working memory to hold several sub-goals simultaneously, instead
    of simply scanning back through the text to see which parentheses have not been
    closed yet.<p>It could also be simply that ADHD people have &quot;branchier&quot;
    thoughts, hopping around a constellation of related concepts that they feel compelled
    to communicate despite being tangential to the main point; parentheses are the
    main lexical construct used to convey such asides.

    by using a lower resolution at the beginning of the generation process and gradually
    transitioning to higher resolutions. This would also help with the attention mechanism
    not getting overwhelmed when generating a high resolution image from scratch.<p>Also,
    you should probably enforce some kind of frequency cutoff later when you&#x27;re
    generating the high frequencies so that you don&#x27;t destroy low frequency details
    later in the process.

    and pick out the first five things I can reasonably achieve in less then a day
    prioritizing things where I have all the tools and materials at hand. These 5
    things are never entire projects, the goal is to maximally decompose the projects
    until each action is as close to trivial as possible.<p>Once I have my list of
    5 things I stop thinking about anything else and strictly work towards those 5
    goals. There is a sense of relief in having reduced the scope and the tasks tend
    to be finished very quickly. Checking them off the list always feels good.<p>Once
    I have completed my 5 items I start a new list and pick out the next five items.
    This can feel like a huge reward.<p>I&#x27;ve used this system to great effect
    in the past few years.

    engineers we generally react negatively to the idea of bike-shedding or &quot;building
    cathedrals&quot; but the reality is that there is always a bike-shed. The question
    we should be asking is not should we deliberate over the design of the project,
    but rather to what degree does this project (and consequently the business in

    skills<p>3. A vague sense, acquired by osmosis, that industriously working on
    side projects during one&#x27;s free time is what a Real Engineer does<p>Disentangling
    these motives and identifying a clear primary drive behind each project clears
    up the &quot;hydra&quot; feeling wonderfully, as most of the heads simply disappear
    once you realize that you never had a strong reason to pursue them in the first
    place. (3) in particular is often merely the self-castigating whisper of the internalized
    &quot;should&quot; rather than a valid reason to embark on a long and open-ended
    project.

- comment: If your inner motivation is satisfying intellectual interest or improving
    skills, you actually finished the real project behind the facade without a need
    for finishing the official project.<p>So, the mistake boils down to making up
    a fake official project as kind of a justification for satisfying your real needs.
    Maybe you would feel better if you are true to yourself and say &quot;I do this
    to explore and learn, I don&#x27;t actually ever intend to deliver a presentable
    product with this activity.&quot;.

    to learn or just for interest, and those that are trying to accomplish something.
    If I do a project for myself to try things out and learn something I don&#x27;t
    feel any pressure to finish the project. Once I&#x27;ve learned something or had
    some fun, who cares if it&#x27;s &quot;finished&quot; or if anyone else will use
    it. On the other hand, sometimes I&#x27;ll pick up something interesting that
    helps a friend or family member, or just that I need for myself, and there I&#x27;m
    pretty careful about scope. If I can&#x27;t finish it in a couple weekends I&#x27;ll
    look for the closest commercial solution unless it&#x27;s a major once-in-a-decade
    passion project.

- comment: Finishing is super important. Just focus on completing a version 0. Then,
    you can improve it if you feel like it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, just
    finished under a reasonable timeframe.<p>Not finishing and endlessly moving from
    one project to another is bad because it prevents you from making meaningful progress.
    You end up spreading your efforts too thin and never see the results of your hard
    work. This can lead to a lack of closure, decreased motivation, and a cycle of
    unfinished projects that never reach their potential. Moreover, without finishing,
    you miss out on valuable feedback and the sense of accomplishment that comes from
    completing a project, which can be crucial for personal and professional growth.

    touches on side projects to make them usable by others and have been pleasantly
    surprised by the interest. But in <i>most cases</i>, even when I finish, almost
    no one cares.<p>And while <i>finishing</i> is an important lesson early on, just
    so you know how hard that &quot;last 20%&quot; is, it&#x27;s grueling and not
    typically very informative or unique after that first couple times.<p>So I&#x27;m
    now squarely in the camp of do what I want and finish what I want on the side,
    with no guilt. If I enjoy the journey I call it good. Finishing is for the day

- comment: 'Without the &quot;convenient excuse&quot;, the journey starts looking
    like pure procrastination; how do you enjoy it without the guilt about not doing
    more important work that leads to more important results?<p>What if it&#x27;s
    a bit of both? Something dawned on me today when mulling on another related idea
    &quot;systems vs goals&quot;, popularized by Scott Adams in &quot;How to Fail
    at Almost Everything and Still Win Big&quot;[0]. It was a widely popular book
    at the time, even here on HN, but the core idea never worked for me. Nor even
    resonated.<p>Quoting from the book[1]:<p>&quot;A goal is a specific objective
    that you either achieve or don&#x27;t sometime in the future. A system is something
    you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run.
    If you do something every day, its a system. If you&#x27;re waiting to achieve
    it someday in the future, it&#x27;s a goal.&quot;<p>Boring, ain&#x27;t it?<p>For
    me, the problem with project, systems, and enjoying journey over destination is
    that:<p>1) Projects don&#x27;t motivate me for long; past initial excitement,
    I&#x27;m rarely able to muster enough motivation from the dream of finishing something
    (and enjoying the spoil) to move me past static friction.<p>2) &quot;Journey over
    destination&quot; - I mean, if I&#x27;m doing a project, I care about benefits
    and (my imagined) experiences given by whatever it is that I&#x27;ve built or
    completed. Journey is just a distraction at best; typically, it&#x27;s a source
    of stress and many yaks to be shaved, most of them stinky and ugly. If anything,
    I get motivation from ways to <i>shorten the journey</i>.<p>3) Systems are even
    worse. If journey is just distracting me from the goal, systems are about putting
    the goal out of mind entirely, automating it away through habits, changes to environment,
    etc. While probably[2] effective, systems give me zero motivation - they&#x27;re
    too arbitrary, generic.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that, even in this formulation,
    I&#x27;ve been trying to solve for almost a decade now. Recently, I&#x27;ve started
    thinking about what <i>actually</i> motivates me about a project in an ongoing
    fashion; the insight I had today is that it&#x27;s a combination of the &quot;project&quot;
    and &quot;journey&quot; factors:<p>- The base &#x2F; fallback motivation is the
    goal - the benefit I&#x27;ll get when I reach it. Often, the major one is that
    someone will be satisfied or impressed. Even more often, it&#x27;s the relief
    of getting the consequences of not completing it of my mental threat board, and&#x2F;or
    shutting up people who pester me about it. However, that alone is only able to
    keep the project on my mind; it&#x27;s not enough to motivate sustained work.<p>-
    The immediate-term, ongoing motivation is the journey, or specifically the <i>experience
    of proficiency</i>, and all the interesting tangents I find along the way. It&#x27;s
    a necessary condition for me to stay on the task, but I can&#x27;t treat it as
    the main motivation itself - when I try, my mind evaluates the value of the activity
    as zero and pulls emergency brakes; after all, there are much easier ways to get
    immediate gratification, and there are more important things to do, so if I don&#x27;t
    care about reaching the goal, what&#x27;s the point of going for it in the first
    place?<p>Systems don&#x27;t even enter the motivational equation here[3].<p>I
    guess what I&#x27;m trying to say here is that, in terms of motivation, the completion
    of a project and the journey to it are two different things entirely; treating
    them as alternatives is a category error.<p>Also my rambling here is saying that,
    at this moment, nothing for me has the right combination of &quot;project&quot;
    and &quot;journey&quot; factors - otherwise I&#x27;d be doing something else than
    writing HN comments.<p>(And yes, finishing projects completely is hard, because
    that last 20% of work contains the 80% of chores and annoying tangents that completely
    ruin the experience of the journey.)<p>--<p>- [0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;How_to_Fail_at_Almost_Everything_and_Still_Win_Big"

- comment: I like to ship stuff. I actually get pleasure from releasing stuff into
    the wild.<p>Shipping, is, by definition, &quot;finishing.&quot; Lots of boring
    stuff involved.<p>Most of my R&amp;D and learning is geared towards shipping projects.<p>I
    will &quot;let stuff go,&quot; if I find I&#x27;m in a rabbithole. Learning when
    to do this, is important. I just let go of some ML stuff for Apple systems, mainly
    because I can&#x27;t really apply it [yet] to the types of apps that I&#x27;ll
    ship. It wasn&#x27;t a total loss, though, because I learned that I really need
    to use Intents for what I want.<p>So, right now, I am learning Intents development
    for Apple systems. It&#x27;s a pain, because the documentation is really haphazard,
    but I&#x27;m muddling through.<p>I&#x27;ll start by adding them to a released
    app that I tend to use as my &quot;pointman&quot; for new stuff, then, I&#x27;ll
    add it to some of my other shipping apps. While I&#x27;m doing this, I&#x27;ll
    become &quot;conversational&quot; in the tech. That&#x27;s how I always learn
    this stuff. Maybe I&#x27;ll write something up on it (like I did for Universal
    Links[0]).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;series&#x2F;universal-links&#x2F;"

- comment: Its not overwhelming clear that finishing is an important piece of a <i>side</i>
    project. Real work at your job is the place where you can prioritize finishing
    over other outcomes. By not forcing yourself to finish everything in your side
    projects you open yourself up to greater levels of exploration and learning which
    is, after all, the point of side projects to begin with.

    I have started working on a blog built on Quarto, and all I have so far is a elaborate
    design and a half complete blog on an LLM tool I had built.<p>But like the comments
    say, I had way too much fun on the journey of a side project, just doing other
    things like configuring the website and playing around with the design elements
    like font and how the overall website looks (I&#x27;m a data scientist and never
    usually get to play with design as much as I want to at work). And recently, with
    claude&#x27;s help built some cool react elements to push my story further.<p>Hopefully
    after this, I ship at least one blog and iterate on the design elements.

    mind while implementing something you have in mind that are unnecessary right
    now by some definition (could be infamously performance- or perhaps convenience-related).
    If you have a list of all the subcomponents you need (or rather, want to have)
    I think it&#x27;s healthy to first sit down and triage everything into some priority
    buckets and only zoom in on the absolute base functionality first for you to be
    able to move on to the next step on top of it for it to be able to ship. Note
    that this step is completely different in nature than what we have already one.
    After that you can go back and do the next bucket and so on and so forth.

    I want to make them.<p>For example, I made a notes web app that syncs to S3, has
    full text search, has a &quot;daily note&quot; button that auto creates a note
    for the day, etc. This app was not the most fun and exciting app to make, but
    I made it anyway because I wanted it to exist.<p>There comes a point in projects
    where you&#x27;re in the middle of it and you want to switch and do something
    else. But if you constantly find the desire for the thing you&#x27;re making,
    invariably you&#x27;ll finish. And it gets more fun after the trough of boredom.

    \ Now:<p>1.) When you run, you\u2019re only finished training when your body gives\
    \ out, you die or give up the sport. In software, a product is never really finished;\
    \ a version is. Therefore if I forget something or mess something up, I already\
    \ know what tasks to work on for the next version. Forgetting something is bad\
    \ but it makes planning easier. If finality is scary, turn it into a yield sign.<p>2.)\
    \ If you want to run well at a distance, you have to specialize in that distance.\
    \ If you train for Leadville and the 100m dash simultaneously, you won\u2019t\
    \ perform as well at either. In software, I work on one version of one product\
    \ at a time. If I have to choose which one to work on when I sit down, I have\
    \ already failed.<p>3.) I\u2019m a human so for me, running is all about pace.\
    \ Anyone can complete any race if they find and keep their pace. Software is the\
    \ same. So find your pace and learn how to keep it. When I\u2019m trying to find\
    \ my pace for a race, I run that pace six days a week regardless of my distance\
    \ - on shorter days, I\u2019ll add in gliders at the end so I get the workout.\
    \ With software, I have to keep the same kind of consistency or it takes me too\
    \ long to get back where I was to ever finish anything.<p>4.) If you want to run\
    \ fast so you can see the stars backs for a few moments, you have to treat every\
    \ single training session just like the race. If you want to run fast enough to\
    \ be one of the stars, it has to be your whole life. With software, everything\
    \ even silly side projects gets the same name - product - and I follow the same\
    \ methods. Practice is always good but deliberate, competitive practice is better."

    on my personal projects is the accumulated accidental* complexity due to tools
    and dependencies. If it&#x27;s been a few weeks since you were last able to code,
    then not only have you lost a lot of context in your working memory, but your
    tools and dependencies will have marched on, and what seems like a harmless update
    will often result in hours untangling a bug with Someone Else&#x27;s Code.<p>Fixing
    Someone Else&#x27;s Code is not the point of such endeavors. Reduce tooling and
    dependency complexity to the bare minimum, even if it means adopting a bit of

- comment: Somehow, I feel like if a project hasn&#x27;t become incredibly boring
    to work on, then it&#x27;s not even close to finished.<p>The hardest part is finishing
    a project pre-revenue. There&#x27;s just little motivation to do it because, at
    that point, it&#x27;s too boring to be about the &#x27;journey&#x27; anymore;
    it becomes all about money... Yet you don&#x27;t know if the project will be able
    to generate revenue so it&#x27;s about &#x27;hypothetical money&#x27;. As someone
    who has a huge number of failed projects under their belt, for me it feels like
    working for &#x27;magic unicorn money&#x27;. I rely 100% on the enthusiasm&#x2F;delusion
    of my non-technical co-founder to keep me going. In my mind, it&#x27;s not going
    to make it... Though I like the fact that my current project is in a niche that
    I would never have chosen on my own because it&#x27;s so damn boring (it&#x27;s
    in HR search&#x2F;recruitment sector *vomits*). I was literally optimizing for
    boringness.<p>I wish I could come up with one of these startups which can be monetized
    straight away, no free tier, no complex sales funnel but I think these opportunities
    are very limited and highly competitive.

    rendering, etc.<p>I feel like if you used a dom parser to walk and only keep nodes
    with text, the html structure and the necessary tag properties (class&#x2F;id
    only maybe?) you&#x27;d have significant savings. Perhaps the xpath thing might
    work better too. You can even even drop necessary symbols and represent it as
    a indented text file.<p>We use readability for things like this but you lose the
    dom structure and their quality reduces with JS heavy websites and  pages with
    actions like &quot;continue reading&quot; which expand the text.<p>Whats the gold
    standard for something like this?

- comment: 'Only works insofar as sites are being nice. A lot of sites do things like:
    render all text via JS, render article text via API, paywall content by showing
    a preview snippet of static text before swapping it for the full text (which lives
    in a different element), lazyload images, lazyload text, etc etc.<p>DOM parsing
    wasn&#x27;t enough for Google&#x27;s SEO algo, either. I&#x27;ll even see Safari&#x27;s
    &quot;reader mode&quot; fail utterly on site after site for some of these reasons.
    I tend to have to scroll the entire page before running it.'

- comment: 'We&#x27;ve been working on AI-automated web scraping at Kadoa[0] and our
    early experiments were similar to the those in the article. We started when only
    the expensive and slow GPT-3 was available, which pushed us to develop a cost-effective
    solution at scale.<p>Here is what we ended up with:<p>- Extraction: We use codegen
    to generate CSS selectors or XPath extraction code. This is more efficient than
    using LLMs for every data extraction. Using an LLM for every data extraction,
    would be expensive and slow, but using LLMs to generate the scraper code and subsequently
    adapt it to website modifications is highly efficient.<p>- Cleansing &amp; transformation:
    We use small fine-tuned LLMs to clean and map data into the desired format.<p>-
    Validation: Unstructured data is a pain to validate. Among traditional data validation
    methods like reverse search, we use LLM-as-a-judge to evaluate the data quality.<p>We
    quickly realized that doing this for a few data sources with low complexity is
    one thing, doing it for thousands of websites in a reliable, scalable, and cost-efficient
    way is a whole different beast.<p>Combining traditional ETL engineering methods
    with small, well-evaluated LLM steps was the way to go for us<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kadoa.com"

- comment: I used to do a lot of web scraping. Cloudflare is an issue, as are a few
    Cloudflare competitors, but scraping can still be useful. We had contracts with
    companies we scraped that allowed us to scrape their sites, specifically so that
    they didn&#x27;t need to do any integration work to partner with us. The most
    anyone had to do on the company side was allowlist us with Cloudflare.<p>Would
    recommend web scraping as a &quot;growth hack&quot; in that way, we got a lot
    of partnerships that we wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have got.

    1.4 Pro) is massively more capable than models you can run on your own machine
    using Ollama - unless you can run something truly monstrous like Llama 3.1 405b,
    but that&#x27;s requires 100GBs of GPU RAM which is very expensive.

    Is there any technique for extracting interactive elements? I reckon listing all
    of inputs&#x2F;controls would not be hard, but finding the corresponding labels&#x2F;articles
    might be tricky.<p>Another thing I wonder is, regarding text extraction, would
    it be a crazy idea to just snapshot the page and ask it to OCR &amp; generate
    a bare minimum html table layout. That way both the content and the spatial relationship
    of elements are maintained (not sure how useful but I&#x27;d like to keep it anyway).

- comment: Starting with my undergrad but fully committing to it by grad school, I
    (and several of my friends who went through similar programs in math&#x2F;cs)
    have a strategy that uses this. If, for example, I had a new problem set in a
    math course, I would bash my head against it in the evening for an hour or two.
    I&#x27;d make an honest attempt but move on from problems quickly if I got stuck.
    I&#x27;d rarely get much done. Then, I&#x27;d do my best to get a good night&#x27;s
    sleep (at least 7.5 hours quality sleep). In the morning I&#x27;d try the problems
    again first thing after coffee, and frequently found that I could do a significant
    portion of the problems, or at least make headway. This might be biased by the
    fact that I&#x27;m really much more of a morning person to begin with, but I know
    several people who use this strategy.

- comment: This reminds me of what I learned about myself during my years spent at
    the university. I observed that in the morning my brain is better at understanding
    new concepts. Mornings were the best time for me to practice and improve problem
    solving, but I tend to remember less details of what I come across. However, at
    about 2pm my brain appears to switch to memorizing mode, where I struggle with
    problem solving compared to the morning, but I will remember a lot more of what
    I read. I structured my learning activity leveraging this observation. Even to
    this day (am 46) I can feel the same tendency, e.g., if a problem seems somewhat
    difficult, I just wait until the next morning, if I can, only to find it easy
    to come up with some solution that seemed out of reach the previous evening. Also,
    I try to do most of my reading at night (well, life with a family doesn&#x27;t
    leave a whole lot of options for timing anyway).

    been working on a little image editing application, implementing anti-aliased

    enough and close enough hack to deal with the jagged edges).<p>The fever had me
    hallucinating circles and how to render them for the entire (unbelievably tedious)
    night.<p>The other time I&#x27;d been playing RA95 for a few hours (I was addicted

    minutes.<p>I called it an early night (it was about eight o&#x27;clock) and went

    to music, watching TV, reading, playing with my kid, almost anything.  But giving
    my head a full hour to rest from a deep problem helps me sleep without ending
    up in some logical nightmare that only some construct from my problem could resolve

    in a crisis; he was very serious about getting enough sleep so that he was well-rested
    during any battles. When other officers would stay awake for 36 to 48 hours at
    a stretch, he would read a novel and get sleep because he knew he had enormous
    responsibilities that needed him at his best.<p>He also walked 8+ miles a day,
    even when at sea he would make sure he walked around the ship, usually with some
    other officers to discuss any pertinent issues of the day. Walking is great for

- comment: I&#x27;m amazed by people who can simply just..decide to sleep with some
    crisis hanging over their head.<p>I really wish it was a skill I had, because
    I&#x27;m well aware of how badly I perform when I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep.<p>I
    inevitably end up with the worst of both worlds - trying to sleep at an early
    hour, can&#x27;t sleep due to the gears in my brain ticking over, getting frustrated
    at the fact I can&#x27;t sleep, which makes it even harder to fall asleep.<p>I
    end up just as tired as I would have been if I had simply stayed up for 4 more
    hours, but at least then I could have actually done something in that time besides
    stew over the fact that I can&#x27;t sleep.

- comment: For me it was to spend time during the day to just think. This could be
    going for a 20 minute walk, or just lying in bed for 10 minutes or so with no
    phone or whatever. Let yourself be bored.<p>This way when it came to bedtime my
    thoughts aren&#x27;t racing because I&#x27;ve already allowed my brain time to
    process them.<p>I think for many people when they go to bed it is the first time
    in the day they&#x27;re not distracting themselves, and have time to just <i>think</i>.
    So all the thoughts from the whole day, or days, come rushing in at once and you
    feel like your &quot;mind is racing&quot;. If you do this earlier in the day you
    might find it a lot easier to get to sleep.

- comment: 'Yes there are definitely structures in my life - I  live within the bounds
    of project deadlines.<p>However within those bounds, I try to do those things
    that come easiest - that is, those things where I have the confidence to say that
    I see a possible solution. I avoid forcing myself to do something where I do not
    have the feeling of having an approach&#x2F;solution&#x2F;idea.<p>Instead I do
    something else and 99 times out of 100, an idea pops up and I return to the original
    activity&#x2F;task&#x2F;project. However there is no time limit when this will
    happen. And that is the unplannable part of my approach. I do stick to deadlines
    by delivering what has been done and having good excuses for those that have not
    - delivering on time is more important the completion.<p>I try to stay busy with
    tasks so things do get done and loose-ends are tired up. Something is always completed
    and with it, progress is made.<p>On the other hand, when I have no ideas, a moment
    of silent meditation&#x2F;power-napping&#x2F;slumber helps to calm the mind. As
    I get older, I have come to realise that planning is necessary but shouldn&#x27;t
    dominate. Calming the mind and emptying it helps my unconscious to catchup, i.e,
    reorginise, restructure and plan but an unconscious plan.<p>There is no guarantee
    that the approach I take will work, in many cases, I make a learning that a particular
    approach was not a good idea! But that then becomes the result: to have made the
    learning and do it better&#x2F;differently the next time.<p>Important is also
    to stay positive and never forget to see the positive learnings from attempts
    that fail. That is the hard part: be prepared to fail and learn from that. I try
    not to be hard on myself for perhaps taking the wrong approach - hindsight is
    100%, everything else is guesswork.<p>Within the bounds of a project, what I&#x27;m
    describing is nothing more than explorative solution identification - i.e., from
    point A, we want to get to point B but have no correct or defined path to take.
    So how to find the correct path? I don&#x27;t know and a random or &quot;unconscious&quot;
    approach is as good as anything else - with the assurance of not going around
    in circles by maintaining good documentation (for me that&#x27;s a 2 dimensional
    mind map).'

    after any learning&#x2F;training session, whether it be mental or physical, instead
    of just resting while still awake.<p>If sleep is the best state for the body to
    be in to consolidate memories, reduce fatigue, etc., then it would seem logical
    to try and be in the sleep state as much as possible.<p>Obviously the difficult
    part is actually being able to fall asleep on command without using some kind
    of pharmaceutical, but I do think falling asleep quickly is something that can

    of a traditional yoga asana practice and I&#x27;ve wondered the same thing about
    rest after a learning&#x2F;training session. Typically at the end of a practice
    session of yoga asana (and sometimes in between postures) you&#x27;ll take savasana
    and just rest in open awareness. A teacher of mine would always say this is the
    most important part of class, to let everything integrate in.<p>When I started
    training Muay Thai I found that I often would &quot;lose&quot; a lot of what we
    had worked on in class, and then started taking savasana right when I got home.
    In that not-quite-sleep state my brain would replay what we worked on.<p>Sometimes
    if I&#x27;m really bashing into a wall with some coding problem I&#x27;ll just
    take savasana for 10-15 minutes and get back to it. I feel like it helps.

    It also claims that REM sleep is a core part of this experience. The analogy that
    I found most useful is that REM sleep writes data from the cache to hard disk.
    In the process it cleanses that data reducing the emotional overload attached
    with it.<p>Say you just experienced grief. Dreaming about it is an essential in
    the process of getting over it.<p>REM sleep is inhibited when you use sleeping
    pills or alcohol.

- comment: '&gt; Are we unconscious when we sleep<p>I don&#x27;t think that is the
    right question to ask. Sleeping person is unconscious almost by definition. They
    don&#x27;t respond to stimuli and they don&#x27;t do much of anything besides
    breathing and just laying there.<p>&gt; do we merely lose the capacity to remember?<p>That
    is a better question. Some people remembers their dreams. Sometimes people can
    remember stimuli which happened while they were asleep. (For example it happened
    multiple times to me that noises happening around me where incorporated into my
    dreams in various forms.) So if sleeping were just amnesia then these dream memories
    would need to be explained somehow.'

    video [1] but it has no audio or explanations at all.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand

    desired character directly. For languages like Chinese I understand because there
    are thousands of characters, but aren&#x27;t most or all African writing systems
    based on small alphabets? I shudder to think of having to learn to input English
    phonetically.<p>So if you&#x27;re looking for opinions, my first one is that your
    pages need to do a better job at explaining what current problems are (with multiple
    clear examples for each), where current solutions fail (with clear examples of
    how), and how your solution is different and better (again, with clear examples).<p>Good

    \ from Morocco, and most people here (myself included) are accustomed to typing\

    \ phonetic system (read in french way) that combines the Latin alphabet with numbers\
    \ to represent specific sounds or letters that don\u2019t have a direct equivalent\
    \ in the Latin script.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    \u0642 is replaced by &quot;q&quot;\n\

    \ (though &quot;kh&quot; is more common)\n    \u063A is replaced by &quot;4&quot;\
    \ (or &quot;gh&quot;)\n    The rest is just a 1 to 1 conversion to how the letter\

    the symbols that latin allows (before you get into accents). the workaround is
    to combine multiple symbols to replicate the phonetic sound the target character

- comment: As a &quot;african&quot; myself, living and working in africa for the last
    46 years, and speaking 4 different african languages. I am struggling to understand
    what &quot;problem&quot; this is trying to solve? It&#x27;s never been an issue
    to type in an &quot;african&quot; language. And what is meant by &quot;african&quot;
    There is a big difference between for example zulu from south africa and arabic
    in morocco. And then we are not even touching on the thousands of languages in
    between that in the rest of africa.

- comment: Similar to other commenters, I am curious to know what is the problem with
    african languages? Can&#x27;t you just make a button for each character in the
    alphabet? (The readme mentions it is a phonetic-based input method, so I assume
    African languages use alphabets, not some logograms, right?)<p>What is common
    for African languages that allows solving the problem for all of them together
    in one software package? (How meaningful, for example, whould be a software package
    for Eurasian languages?)<p>I watched the video - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pythonbrad&#x2F;afrim-keyboard&#x2F;</a>

    of the words using the latin alphabet, and the software translates it to the abugida
    symbols?<p>Seems plausable, especially because he types several latin characters
    to get one symbol.<p>Interesting to note that sometimes he also uses digits.

- comment: '&gt; <i>While they were teenagers in the late 1980s, brothers Ibrahima
    and Abdoulaye Barry devised the alphabetic script to transcribe the Fulani language.[3][6]
    One method they used involved them closing their eyes and drawing lines. After
    looking at their drawn shapes, they would pick which ones would look the most
    to them like a good glyph for a letter, and associate it with whatever sound they
    felt it would represent.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure if I should be impressed that
    this has turned into an actual script, or disappointed that so many people thought
    this was a good idea.<p>Hot take: artificially creating new scripts that need
    to be taught from scratch to everybody and require new fonts, layout engines,
    etc hinders language adoption&#x2F;preservation instead of helping it.'

    it&#x27;s more that Fulani speakers truly appreciated having an alphabetic script
    that is able to adequately represent the distinct sounds of their language without
