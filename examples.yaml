  - I'm so turned off by immigrants that insult America. Why come here? Why stay here? It's not like a hundred years ago, get back on a plane. This woman seems to have issues of her own to work out. Marriage takes two.
  - Not sure what is ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù about my comment. What is disgusting is you calling Americans ‚Äúshit heads‚Äù. Bleeding heart hater- ‚Äúpoor foreigner ü•∫ but the citizens of this country horrible shit heads! just like all men.‚Äù lol Please- keep trolling
  - PS immigrants didn‚Äôt build this country, Americans did. Immigrants helped yes, but I refuse your argument. It‚Äôs propaganda.
  - How idiotic. I didn't call ALL Americans shit heads just SOME, and by some I am referring to the pedophilic type of people who reside in America. If you maybe actually read what I said you wouldn‚Äôt have missed that. You have zero understanding of American history obviously. THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY QUITE LITERALLY WERE FROM BRITAIN- ANOTHER COUNTRY, thus making them immigrants. The only American people in this country are the Native American Indians who we beat and scoured into small reserves in various parts of the country, lacerating them from most of American society. So no, what is gross is your support of pedophilia and xenophobia. How could you be so cruel?? This poor woman who wanted nothing but to build a happy and safe life for herself in America- THE LEGAL AND PROPER WAY might I add, then ignorant people like you come on here and talk nonsense.
  - It's not proper to stay married to a pedophile for selfish reasons.
  - 'lol as soon as I get my papers Ill leave that kid toucher‚Äù. Stop with the passive aggressive bs: ‚Äúdid you read?l‚Äù Yes I did. DID YOU?! Stop moving the goal posts and definitions. I am not an immigrant, my mom and dad were not immigrants. Most Americans are and were not immigrants. According to your propaganda Indians too are immigrants from Asia and Russia lands making the crossing over the ‚ÄúBering Straight‚Äù. lol your propaganda was a marketing campaign, a push to raise money to finish the Statue of Liberty and bring it over from France. I don‚Äôt approve of the way the author dehumanizes Americans as like we are lab rats being studied. She has no right to be here and no one is stopping her from going home, which she should have, if she was truly in an abusive relationship.'
  - RACHAEL, did you read the story. She needed proper documents before she could divorce the man. As soon as she completed that process, she served him papers.
